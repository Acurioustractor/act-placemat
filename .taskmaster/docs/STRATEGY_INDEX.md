## 🎯 Core Strategic Principles (Always Apply)

From all active documents, these principles guide every decision:

### 1. Business First, Community Later
From BUSINESS_REVENUE_STRATEGY.md:
> "Build sustainable business first, community ownership second. You can't give away what you don't have."

**Application**: Every decision should strengthen business fundamentals before considering community/philosophical aspects.

### 2. Reality Over Vision
From WHERE_WE_ACTUALLY_ARE.md:
> "It is all good and well to have grand philosophical ideals but we want to embed learning and failure and growth into the business - to find ways to start now and build on it."

**Application**: Ground all planning in current capacity (sole trader, actual time, actual resources).

### 3. Cultural Respect Through Action
From WHERE_WE_ACTUALLY_ARE.md Walking the Talk:
> "Don't talk about Indigenous anything until you're spending $25K+ annually with Indigenous businesses and paying Indigenous people for their knowledge."

**Application**: Stop talking, start doing. Economic partnership before philosophical claims.

### 4. Revenue Justifies Everything
From BUSINESS_REVENUE_STRATEGY.md Project Portfolio:
> "Rule: If you can't articulate how a project builds wealth or scales, kill it."

**Application**: Every project, initiative, or time investment must connect to revenue generation or strategic asset building.

### 5. R&D Tax Is Free Money
From BUSINESS_REVENUE_STRATEGY.md and THRIDAY_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md:
> "R&D Tax Offset: $65K-$104K annually if properly documented"

**Application**: Document everything as if it's R&D (most of our work qualifies). This is 25-40% of Year 1 revenue target.
