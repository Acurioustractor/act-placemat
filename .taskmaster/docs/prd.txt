# ACT Platform: Product Requirements Document
## The World's First Community-Owned Impact Platform

### Project Overview
A Curious Tractor is building the world's first community-owned impact platform that makes extractive systems obsolete by giving communities superior technology, intelligence, and ownership of their own data and stories.

### Core Mission
Transform global community power through revolutionary technology that serves community ownership rather than institutional convenience. Build toward "Beautiful Obsolescence" where communities no longer need ACT because they have complete control of their own platforms and futures.

### Key Features Required

#### Phase 1: Production Data Foundation
- Production-grade Supabase database with automated backups and row-level security
- Stabilized API endpoints handling production load with proper error handling
- Community authentication system with permission levels (Community, Partner, Admin)
- Real-time data synchronization between Notion, Supabase, Xero, and other data sources
- Automated retry logic and health monitoring for all external API integrations

#### Phase 2: Community Interface
- Real-time community dashboard showing project status, revenue tracking, and partnership health
- Story management system with consent tracking, AI-powered categorization, and dynamic permissions
- Beautiful project showcase pages with authentic media galleries and impact metrics
- Impact visualization engine with revenue flow tracking and network effect mapping
- Export tools for community-controlled impact reporting

#### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
- Community Intelligence API analyzing project success patterns and identifying opportunities
- Relationship Intelligence mapping community connections and collaboration potential
- Financial Intelligence with revenue forecasting and grant opportunity matching using AI
- Story Intelligence for community voice amplification and evidence generation for advocacy
- All AI serves community power, not institutional convenience

#### Phase 4: Community Ownership
- Community data control tools enabling complete data export and platform forking
- Beautiful Obsolescence features tracking community capacity for independence
- Global network platform connecting communities worldwide without ACT control
- Mobile React Native app for community member access with offline capabilities
- Revenue sharing automation with blockchain-ready benefit distribution

### Technical Requirements
- Real data only - no fake demos or placeholder content
- Always-live APIs with 99.9% uptime and proper monitoring
- Production-ready code with automated testing and deployment
- Community-first design respecting Indigenous data sovereignty
- Open-source foundation enabling community forking and independence

### Success Metrics
- Communities achieving complete independence from ACT
- 40% of all revenue flowing directly to communities automatically
- 100% community ownership of their data, stories, and intellectual property
- Platform stability with <2 second load times globally
- Zero community complaints about data usage or consent violations

### Business Impact
This platform will demonstrate that communities don't need external saviors - they need superior tools, authentic partnerships, and systems designed for their ownership rather than institutional extraction.

The ultimate success metric is Beautiful Obsolescence: communities saying "ACT? We don't need them anymore. We run this ourselves now."

## SPRINT ADDITION: Unified Intelligence Platform Implementation

### Sprint Context: Data-First Integration Consolidation
This sprint builds on ACT Platform's existing real data assets to create a unified intelligence ecosystem. Current state includes:

**Real Data Assets:**
- 1,000+ LinkedIn contacts with relationship intelligence (299 high-value strategic contacts identified)
- Live Gmail integration with contact intelligence matching
- Active Notion databases with people, projects, and organizational data
- Financial data through Xero integration with bookkeeping intelligence
- Calendar intelligence with contact relationship tracking
- Comprehensive Supabase database with contact and project schemas

**Current Integration Pain Points:**
- 80+ scattered API endpoints across individual service files
- Inconsistent data flow between Gmail, Calendar, Notion, LinkedIn systems
- Manual synchronization creating data drift
- Hard-coded test data rather than leveraging real assets
- Fragmented user experience requiring multiple interface interactions

### Sprint Objectives

#### Primary Goals
1. **Unified API Architecture**: Consolidate 80+ endpoints into 6 cohesive service layers
2. **Real Data Integration**: Build entirely on existing 1,000+ contact relationships and financial data
3. **Co-founder Intelligence Dashboard**: Single interface for project management, contact intelligence, financial oversight
4. **Continuous Connection Monitoring**: Ensure all integrations remain synchronized
5. **Review and Feedback Systems**: Implement validation to prevent data drift

#### Success Metrics for Sprint
- All major integrations accessible through unified API layer
- Real-time synchronization between Gmail, Calendar, Notion, LinkedIn
- Zero data loss during consolidation process
- Co-founder workflow reduced from multiple tools to single dashboard
- 100% uptime for critical integration connections
- 80% reduction in manual data entry for co-founders

#### Technical Architecture

**Core Integration Services:**
1. **Unified Authentication Service** - Single OAuth flow for all platforms
2. **Contact Intelligence Engine** - Merge LinkedIn, Gmail, Notion contact data using existing relationship analysis
3. **Project Management Orchestrator** - Connect Notion projects with contact relationships
4. **Financial Intelligence Hub** - Integrate Xero data with project and contact insights
5. **Calendar Intelligence Service** - Auto-detect and enrich meeting relationships
6. **Real-time Synchronization Engine** - Maintain data consistency across platforms

**Data Flow Architecture:**
```
Gmail/Calendar ←→ Contact Intelligence Engine ←→ Notion Projects
        ↓                    ↓                        ↓
LinkedIn Analytics ←→ Unified Dashboard ←→ Financial Intelligence
        ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Supabase Data Lake ←→ Real-time Sync ←→ API Gateway
```

#### Co-founder User Journeys

**Morning Intelligence Workflow:**
1. Single login provides access to all systems
2. View high-priority relationship opportunities (299 strategic contacts from existing analysis)
3. Real-time updates from Notion with contact linkages
4. Xero data with project and relationship context
5. Meeting suggestions based on strategic contact analysis
6. AI-generated recommendations for engagement and follow-up

**Project Development Workflow:**
1. Notion project automatically creates contact relationship tracking
2. LinkedIn and Gmail data pre-populate relevant stakeholders
3. Xero integration provides real-time project cost tracking
4. Calendar intelligence tracks meeting frequency and engagement
5. Strategic insights suggest optimization opportunities

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Audit existing API endpoints and data schemas
- Design unified authentication system
- Create consolidated database models
- Implement basic API gateway structure

**Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 3-4)**

- Deploy feedback mechanisms for data quality
- Establish performance monitoring and alerting

#### Quality Assurance

**Data Integrity Measures:**
- All implementations tested against existing 1,000+ contacts
- Automated testing of cross-platform data consistency
- Real-time alerts for integration failures
- Safe migration paths with data recovery options

**Review Mechanisms:**
- Daily sync reports for data flow accuracy validation
- Weekly integration health assessments
- Monthly data audit for cross-platform consistency
- Quarterly architecture review for performance optimization

#### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- Complete backup systems before any migration
- Graceful fallback to existing individual APIs
- Load testing with real data volumes
- OAuth and encryption validation across all services

**Business Risks:**
- Phased rollout with parallel system access
- Validation of relationship data accuracy
- Double-verification of Xero integration accuracy
- Seamless Notion integration without data loss

#### Sprint Timeline
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
