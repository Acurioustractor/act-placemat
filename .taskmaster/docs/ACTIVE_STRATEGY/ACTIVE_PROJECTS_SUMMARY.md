## 🚨 Questions for Research to Answer

1. **Which projects generate actual revenue?** (consulting vs concepts)
2. **What's the revenue per project?** (Need to understand economics)
3. **Which are retainers vs one-time?** (Recurring revenue analysis)
4. **What can be productized?** (Empathy Ledger? Storytelling platform?)
5. **What should be killed?** (33 is too many for one person)
6. **What's the hiring priority?** (Based on project types)

## 💡 Immediate Observations (Pre-Research)

### Strengths Visible
- **Anchor clients**: PICC, SMART (multiple projects each = stable revenue)
- **Platform potential**: Empathy Ledger appears across multiple contexts
- **Specialist positioning**: Justice + Storytelling + Indigenous cultural work
- **Recent momentum**: High activity in Sept 2024 (5 new/updated projects)

### Concerns Visible
- **Too many projects**: 33 active = impossible for solo operation
- **Unclear revenue**: Which generate income vs concepts/passion projects?
- **Duplicate efforts**: 2 versions of "Travelling women's car" project
- **Missing metadata**: Many projects lack tags/categorization
- **Concept vs delivery**: Mix of products, concepts, and client work unclear

### Urgent Actions Needed
1. **Revenue triage**: Categorize projects by actual revenue generation
2. **Kill/defer list**: Reduce 33 to 5-8 core revenue projects
3. **Metadata cleanup**: Tag all projects properly in Notion
4. **Client mapping**: Which projects = which paying clients?
5. **Time tracking**: Where is time actually going?
