    "AI summary": "The manifesto advocates for designing systems that intentionally create obsolescence for social entrepreneurs, empowering communities to take ownership and solve their own problems. It critiques the social innovation industrial complex for fostering dependency and emphasizes the importance of transferring knowledge and expertise to communities. Success is measured by how unnecessary the creator becomes, promoting community-led solutions over external interventions, while challenging the mythology of scaling impact as a form of colonialism. The approach encourages depth in relationships and local context rather than broad reach, aiming for genuine community empowerment and self-determination."
