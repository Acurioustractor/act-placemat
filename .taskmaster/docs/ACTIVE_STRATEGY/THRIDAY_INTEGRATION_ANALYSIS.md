## Critical Gap Analysis for A Curious Tractor

### ❌ GAP 1: R&D Tax Incentive Compliance

**What's Needed**:
1. Contemporaneous R&D activity documentation
2. Time tracking for R&D personnel (by project)
3. Expense categorization by R&D project
4. Technical uncertainty register
5. Experiment/iteration logging
6. AusIndustry registration integration
7. R&D tax offset calculation (43.5%)

**What Thriday Provides**:
- ❌ No R&D-specific features mentioned
- ❌ No project-based time tracking
- ❌ No technical uncertainty documentation
- ❌ No R&D tax offset calculations
- ❌ No AusIndustry integration

**Impact**:
- **Cannot claim $130,500-$217,500 annual R&D offset** without proper documentation
- Must use separate system for R&D compliance
- Manual reconciliation between systems required

**Recommended Solution**:
- Use Thriday for general accounting
- Add **dedicated R&D software** (e.g., R&D Portal, Swanson Reed tools)
- OR build custom R&D tracking integrated with AI assistant
- Manual monthly reconciliation of R&D expenses

---

### ❌ GAP 2: Multi-Entity Structure Support

**What's Needed**:
1. Parent cooperative accounting
2. Multiple SPV subsidiary accounts
3. Consolidated reporting across entities
4. Inter-company transaction tracking
5. Transfer pricing documentation
6. Separate P&L per entity
7. Dividend/patronage rebate calculations

**What Thriday Provides**:
- ✅ Supports "multiple business entities under single login"
- ⚠️ **Unclear**: Does this mean separate legal entities or just departments?
- ❌ No mention of cooperative-specific features
- ❌ No consolidation reporting mentioned
- ❌ No inter-company transaction handling

**Impact**:
- May need separate Thriday account per SPV ($29.95 × number of entities)
- Manual consolidation required
- No built-in cooperative dividend/rebate calculations

**Recommended Solution**:
- **Option A**: One Thriday account per legal entity (cooperative + each SPV)
  - Cost: $29.95 × 4 = ~$120/month
  - Manual consolidation via spreadsheets or custom tool
- **Option B**: Use Thriday for main entity only, Xero for complex structures
  - Hybrid approach: Thriday for day-to-day, Xero for compliance/reporting

---

### ❌ GAP 3: API Integration for AI Assistant

1. Programmatic access to transaction data

**What's Needed**:
1. Public-facing financial dashboards
2. Community fund allocations visible

## FAQ: Thriday for A Curious Tractor

### Q: Can Thriday handle our R&D tax incentive claims?
**A**: No, not directly. Thriday has no specific R&D tax features. You'll need:
- Manual R&D expense tracking outside Thriday
- Separate R&D documentation system
- R&D tax specialist for annual claims ($5,000-8,000)

### Q: Does Thriday support cooperatives and multiple SPVs?
**A**: Unclear. Thriday mentions "multiple business entities under one login" but doesn't specify if this means separate legal entities or just departments. For a cooperative + multiple SPVs, you may need:
- Separate Thriday account per entity ($29.95 each), OR
- Use Xero for complex multi-entity structure

### Q: Can we integrate Thriday with our AI assistant?
**A**: Not easily. Thriday has no public API. Options:
- Manual CSV exports (monthly reconciliation)
- Request API access from Thriday (may not exist)
- Use Xero instead for full API access

### Q: What about community transparency dashboards?
**A**: Thriday doesn't support public dashboards. You'll need to:
- Export data manually from Thriday
- Build custom dashboard with AI assistant
- Update monthly (not real-time)

### Q: Is Thriday worth it despite the limitations?
**A**: It depends:
- **Yes if**: You prioritize simplicity, cost savings, and can accept manual R&D tracking
- **No if**: You need full automation, R&D compliance, and API integrations
- **Hybrid if**: You want best of both worlds (Thriday for daily ops, Xero for compliance)
