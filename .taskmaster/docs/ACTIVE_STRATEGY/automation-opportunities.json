  "analysis": "Here are the answers to the questions based on the ecosystem data:\n\n**1. What repetitive tasks across projects can be automated?**\n\n* Automated project health checks: scrape Notion, send summaries\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in tracking and summarizing project progress\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Web scraping tools (e.g., Cheerio), email sending tools (e.g., Mailgun)\n\t+ Implementation effort: Medium (requires development of a web scraper and email sender)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As projects become self-sufficient, automated health checks ensure ACT's role is reduced to advisory\n* AI-powered relationship suggestions: Gmail + CRM data\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in identifying connections between projects\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Email API (e.g., Gmail), CRM integration tools (e.g., Zapier)\n\t+ Implementation effort: Low (requires configuration of APIs and integrations)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, AI-powered suggestions help them identify new connections independently\n\n**2. What data/insights can be automatically collected and shared?**\n\n* Collective impact dashboards: automated metric aggregation\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in tracking and aggregating metrics across projects\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Data aggregation tools (e.g., Google Data Studio), dashboard creation tools (e.g., Tableau)\n\t+ Implementation effort: High (requires development of data pipelines and dashboard design)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, collective impact dashboards provide a single source of truth for their metrics\n* Knowledge base automation: capture learnings from emails/meetings\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in documenting lessons learned from projects\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Email analysis tools (e.g., Mailchimp), meeting note-taking tools (e.g., Otter)\n\t+ Implementation effort: Medium (requires configuration of email and meeting note-taking integrations)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, knowledge base automation helps them capture and apply learnings independently\n\n**3. What connections/introductions can be systematically suggested?**\n\n* Collaborative opportunity detection: match projects on outcomes\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in identifying potential collaborations between projects\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Matching algorithm tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot), project outcome tracking tools (e.g., Notion)\n\t+ Implementation effort: High (requires development of a matching algorithm and integration with project outcome tracking)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, collaborative opportunity detection helps them identify new partners independently\n\n**4. What reporting/tracking can be automated?**\n\n* Automated project status updates: send regular summaries to stakeholders\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in updating stakeholders on project progress\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: Email sending tools (e.g., Mailgun), project tracking tools (e.g., Trello)\n\t+ Implementation effort: Medium (requires configuration of email sender and integration with project tracking tool)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, automated project status updates ensure stakeholders are informed independently\n\n**5. How can AI assist in relationship management at scale?**\n\n* AI-powered relationship suggestions: analyze CRM data and suggest connections\n\t+ Problem: Manual effort in identifying new relationships between projects\n\t+ Tools/Tech needed: AI/ML tools (e.g., Google Cloud AI Platform), CRM integration tools (e.g., Zapier)\n\t+ Implementation effort: High (requires development of an AI-powered recommendation engine and integration with CRM data)\n\t+ Obsolescence support: As organizations become self-sufficient, AI-powered relationship suggestions help them identify new connections independently"
