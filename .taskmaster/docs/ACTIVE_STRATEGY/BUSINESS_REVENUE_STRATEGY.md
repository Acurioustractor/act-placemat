## Project Portfolio Optimization

### Audit Framework (Do This Week)

**For each current project, answer**:

1. **Revenue**: How much does this generate? ($/month)
2. **Profit Margin**: What's left after costs? (%)
3. **Time Investment**: Hours/week required?
4. **Growth Potential**: Can this scale? (Yes/No)
5. **Alignment**: Does this build toward land/wealth goals? (High/Medium/Low)

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Keep & Grow**: High revenue, high margin, scalable, low time
- **Keep & Optimize**: Good revenue, needs efficiency improvements
- **Transition**: Low revenue but strategic, find exit path
- **Kill Immediately**: Low revenue, high time, no growth potential

### Target Portfolio (12 months)

**Core Revenue Projects** (3-5 maximum):
- 2-3 high-value consulting clients ($150K-$300K total)
- 1-2 platform development retainers ($60K-$180K total)
- 1 product development (ACT Placemat SaaS or AI Agent)

**Strategic Projects** (1-2 maximum):
- Projects that build IP, reputation, or network
- Accept lower revenue if high strategic value
- Time-box to prevent scope creep

**Kill List**:
- Projects generating <$5K/year
- Projects consuming >10 hours/week with no growth path
- "Passion projects" that don't generate revenue or strategic value

**Rule**: If you can't articulate how a project builds wealth or scales, kill it.

## Hiring Strategy: First Employee

### Why Hire? (The Math)

**Current**: You're doing everything
- Available time: 40 hours/week
- Billable rate (opportunity cost): $200/hour
- Potential revenue: $8K/week = $416K/year
- Actual revenue: Limited by your time

**With First Hire** ($60K salary):
- You focus on: High-value consulting, business development, strategy
- They handle: Project delivery, operations, farm management
- Your time freed: 20 hours/week
- Additional revenue: 20 hours × $200 × 50 weeks = $200K
- ROI: $200K revenue - $60K cost = $140K profit increase

### Role: Operations/Delivery Manager

**Responsibilities**:
- Project delivery and client communication
- Farm/land operations management
- System administration and maintenance
- Research documentation (R&D tax compliance)

**Profile**:
- Technical capability (can code, can farm)
- Self-directed and trustworthy
- Shares values but focused on execution
- Salary: $60K-$80K + potential profit share

**Hire Timeline**: Month 3-6 (after project audit, once revenue is predictable)

---

## Financial Systems: Thriday vs Xero

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

**Use Thriday For** ($29.95/month):
- Primary business banking (2.6% interest on deposits)
- Day-to-day bookkeeping automation
- BAS/GST compliance
- Receipt capture and categorization
- Invoicing and payments

**Use Xero For** ($59/month - R&D add-on):
- **R&D tax compliance tracking** (CRITICAL - worth $65K-$104K/year)
- Multi-entity accounting (when you form cooperative)
- Advanced reporting for grant applications
- Integration with R&D tax specialists

**Total Cost**: $89/month = $1,068/year
**Value Generated**: $65K-$104K R&D offset + better financial control
**ROI**: 60x-97x

### Critical Meeting Questions for Thriday Team

From `.taskmaster/docs/THRIDAY_MEETING_QUESTIONS.md`, prioritize:

1. **R&D Tax Features**: "Can Thriday track and categorize R&D expenditure for AusIndustry compliance?"
   - If NO: Keep Xero for R&D tracking

2. **API Access**: "Does Thriday provide API access for AI business agent integration?"
   - If NO: Limits automation potential

3. **Multi-Entity Support**: "How does Thriday handle multiple entities under one umbrella?"
   - Critical for future cooperative structure

4. **Data Export**: "Can we export complete financial data for external analysis?"
   - Need this for grant applications and strategic planning

## What This Enables (24 Months)

Once the business is generating $500K-$1M annually with strong cash flow and assets:

### Option 1: Community Ownership Transition
- Convert profitable business to cooperative structure
- You retain significant equity but share ownership
- Community members can buy in over time
- Business funds the transition (not your savings)

### Option 2: Build Parallel Community Business
- Keep A Curious Tractor as commercial entity
- Profits fund separate community-owned venture
- Lower risk, cleaner separation
- Demonstrates model before asking others to join

### Option 3: Hybrid Model
- Commercial arm funds community initiatives
- Gradually increase community ownership percentage
- Proven business reduces risk for community members

**Key Principle**: Build the wealth first, then decide how to share it. You can't build community ownership on hope and philosophy - you need profitable, sustainable business generating surplus to distribute.

---

## Cultural Respect (Without Appropriation)

### What This Strategy Enables

**Financial Support for Indigenous Businesses**:
- Once generating $500K+, commit 5-10% to purchasing from Indigenous suppliers
- $25K-$100K annually to Indigenous businesses (real impact, not words)

**Land Stewardship Learning**:
- Once land is generating revenue, invite Indigenous land managers as paid consultants
- Budget $10K-$20K annually for cultural land management guidance
- Learn by doing (and paying fairly), not by claiming

**Employment Pathways**:
- When hiring, prioritize Indigenous candidates for farm/land roles
- Pay above-market rates, provide training and development
- Build real relationships through economic partnership

**Respectful Inspiration**:
- Study Indigenous economic models AFTER you've built sustainable business
- Acknowledge inspiration without claiming to practice it
- "Learning from" not "implementing Aboriginal governance"

**Rule**: Don't talk about Indigenous anything until you're spending $25K+ annually with Indigenous businesses and paying Indigenous people for their knowledge. Otherwise, you're appropriating, not honoring.

## Next Steps: From This Document

1. **Read `WHERE_WE_ACTUALLY_ARE.md`** for brutal honesty check
2. **Complete Monday's project audit** (see Immediate Action Plan)
3. **Register for R&D tax incentive** (Wednesday) - potential $65K-$104K
4. **Start one land revenue stream** (Thursday) - glamping or events
5. **Review this strategy in 30 days** with actual numbers from project audit

**Remember**:
- Sustainable business FIRST
- Community ownership LATER (when you have something worth sharing)
- Revenue and wealth building is not greedy - it's responsible
- You can't give away what you don't have

This is not a philosophical exercise. This is a business that needs to generate wealth to survive and eventually support the community ownership vision. Focus on the numbers, build the assets, create the surplus. Everything else follows from that foundation.
