Estimated revenue: $50K - $100K per year.\n2. **Murrup + ACT**: Although the status is Active 🔥, it's unclear if this project generates recurring revenue. However, given its active status, it might have some long-term potential. Estimated revenue: $20K - $50K per year.\n\n**One-time Consulting vs Long-term Retainers:**\n\n1. **PICC Annual Report**: This project appears to be a one-time consulting engagement, focusing on creating an annual report for PICC.

Estimated revenue: $10K - $20K per year.\n\n**Productized Offerings:**\n\n1. **Fairfax & PLACE tech**: Although the status is Unknown, this project might be related to creating a product or service for Fairfax & PLACE. Given the expertise in AI, platforms, data systems, and the fact that it's tagged with \"tech,\" there could be potential for productizing this offering. Estimated revenue: $100K - $250K per year.\n2. **Go big // Funding ACT**: This project is active, and given its focus on funding, it might have some recurring revenue potential if turned into a productized service. Estimated revenue: $50K - $100K per year.\n\n**Projects to Kill (Low Revenue, High Time):**\n\n1. **Designing for Obsolescence**: Although this project is active, there's little information available about its revenue potential or long-term prospects.\n2. **MingaMinga Rangers**: This project seems like a low-priority initiative with limited revenue potential.\n\n**Common Client Needs:**\n\nBased on the projects listed, common client needs emerge in:\n\n1. Digital transformation and technology implementation\n2. Data analysis and systems development\n3. Cultural preservation and connection\n\nThese needs could be packaged into productized offerings or consulting services to attract more clients and generate recurring revenue.\n\n**Alignment with Year 1 Revenue Target:**\n\nThe provided revenue estimates indicate that some projects have the potential to contribute significantly to the $255K-$529K Year 1 revenue target.

Continue investing in SMART Connect, aiming for $50K - $100K per year in recurring revenue.\n3. Explore opportunities to turn Murrup + ACT into a long-term retainer agreement or productized service.\n4. Develop a digital transformation and technology implementation productized offering to attract more clients and generate additional revenue.\n5. Discontinue or re-prioritize projects like Designing for Obsolescence, MingaMinga Rangers, and Uncle Allan Palm Island Art due to their low revenue potential.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are based on the provided project list and may not reflect the actual revenue potential. Further analysis and research are necessary to refine these projections."
