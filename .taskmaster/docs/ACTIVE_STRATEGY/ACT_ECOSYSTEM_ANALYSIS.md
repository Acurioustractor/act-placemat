# ACT Ecosystem Analysis: First Principles Approach
**Generated**: 2025-10-03T22:28:50.812Z
**Purpose**: Understand how ACT supports organizations to thrive and become obsolete

---

## Core Principle

**ACT is NOT about**:
- Maximizing profit
- Building an empire
- Reducing projects to focus

**ACT IS about**:
- Supporting organizations to thrive
- Creating conditions for community-led impact
- Bringing leaders together on shared outcomes
- Automating support and becoming obsolete
- Finding logical pathways from philanthropy → community impact

---

## 1. ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW

### The Network
- **100 People** in CRM (leaders, collaborators, community members)
- **70 Organizations** (partners, clients, community groups)
- **39 Opportunities** (potential collaborations)
- **64 Projects** (33 active, serving diverse communities)

### Current State
This is not "too many projects" - this is ACT's purpose in action:
Supporting diverse community-led initiatives across justice, health, culture, and innovation.

The challenge is not to reduce, but to **systematize support** so ACT can serve well and become obsolete.

---

## 2. RELATIONSHIP NETWORK ANALYSIS

Based on the provided ecosystem analysis, here are some answers to the questions:

1. **Key leaders/connectors in this network:**
	* PICC (various projects) appears to be a central hub with multiple projects and initiatives.
	* Uncle Allan is mentioned as part of the Palm Island Art project.
	* ACT itself may also play a connector role, given its purpose is to support organizations.
2. **Organizations working toward similar outcomes:**
	* Multiple projects under PICC share similar goals related to community-led impact.
	* Organizations like SMART Connect and Go big // Funding ACT seem to be focused on funding or financial support for community initiatives.
3. **Potential collaborations between leaders/orgs:**
	* The RPPP Stream Two: Precinct delivery project could benefit from collaboration with organizations like SMART Connect or Go big // Funding ACT, which may offer resources or expertise in funding and financial management.
	* The MingaMinga Rangers project and the NFP leaders interview project share similar goals related to community development; a potential collaboration between these projects could lead to more effective outcomes.
4. **Patterns of communication/connection:**
	* Many projects under PICC seem to be connected through shared leadership or initiative, indicating an internal network within PICC.
	* ACT's involvement in various projects suggests a connection between the organization and its supported initiatives.
5. **How can ACT bring people together on shared outcomes?**
	* Hosting regular meetings or forums for leaders and representatives of connected organizations (e.g., PICC, SMART Connect, Go big // Funding ACT) could facilitate collaboration and information sharing.
6. **Habitual check-ins:**
	* Regular progress updates from supported initiatives to ACT would help maintain connection and ensure the organization is aware of ongoing work.
7. **Where can ACT automate support and step back?**
	* Automating administrative tasks or streamlining communication through project management tools could free up resources for more hands-on support, allowing ACT to focus on high-impact activities.

Some specific examples from the data:

* The SMART Connect project lists several goals related to community engagement, which aligns with PICC's broader mission. A collaboration between these projects could strengthen community impact.
* The NFP leaders interview project explores strategies for effective governance within non-profit organizations. ACT could facilitate connections between this project and other initiatives under PICC or supported by the organization.

By identifying key connectors, shared outcomes, potential collaborations, communication patterns, and opportunities to automate support, ACT can optimize its role as a supportive network and amplify community-led impact.

## 3. SHARED OUTCOMES ACROSS PROJECTS

Based on the provided data, I will analyze the projects to identify common outcomes, potential collaborations, connections between leaders/organizations, logical pathways from philanthropy to community impact, and sense-making processes.

**1. What OUTCOMES are multiple projects working toward?**

Upon reviewing the projects, several outcomes emerge:

* **Justice outcomes:** Oonchiumpa (id: 1d4ebcf9-81cf-80a2-8c12-e5c56d78de10), Maningrida - Justice Reinvestment (id: 1e7ebcf9-81cf-8038-9969-ccc7fb897b43)
* **Health/wellness outcomes:** Custodian Economy (id: 1d7ebcf9-81cf-808b-a394-f2e547d6ee6c), AIME (id: 1daebcf9-81cf-809f-b0fa-f297c464e192)
* **Cultural preservation outcomes:** None explicitly mentioned, but projects like Wilya Janta Communications (id: 1f4ebcf9-81cf-80c5-9b67-de30812aeee4) and A Curious Tractor Conservation Collective (ACT-CC) (id: 1f5ebcf9-81cf-8096-a353-fd4d60bfd3d9) may have indirect connections
* **Storytelling/narrative outcomes:** Empathy Ledger projects, such as QFCC Empathy Ledger (id: 1d7ebcf9-81cf-8075-8112-d0809ea7b64c), AIME (id: 1daebcf9-81cf-809f-b0fa-f297c464e192), and YAC story and action (id: 1d8ebcf9-81cf-8048-b850-c088451f2aed)

**2. Which projects could collaborate on shared outcomes?**

* **Justice:** Oonchiumpa, Maningrida - Justice Reinvestment, QFCC Empathy Ledger
* **Health/wellness:** Custodian Economy, AIME
* **Storytelling/narrative:** Empathy Ledger projects (QFCC, AIME, YAC), Wilya Janta Communications

**3. What leaders/organizations should be connected?**

Based on the outcomes and potential collaborations:

* Justice: Connect Oonchiumpa with Maningrida - Justice Reinvestment, QFCC Empathy Ledger
* Health/wellness: Bring together Custodian Economy, AIME
* Storytelling/narrative: Facilitate connections between Empathy Ledger projects (QFCC, AIME, YAC) and Wilya Janta Communications

**4. What are logical pathways from philanthropy → community impact?**

Based on the analysis:

* **Justice pathway:** Philanthropic support for Oonchiumpa or Maningrida - Justice Reinvestment could lead to improved justice outcomes in communities.
* **Health/wellness pathway:** Funding Custodian Economy or AIME could result in enhanced health and wellness outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations.
* **Storytelling/narrative pathway:** Supporting Empathy Ledger projects (QFCC, AIME, YAC) or Wilya Janta Communications can lead to increased storytelling and narrative-driven community impact.

**5. How can outcomes be measured collectively vs individually?**

To measure collective outcomes:

* Develop a shared framework for measuring justice, health/wellness, and cultural preservation outcomes across projects.
* Establish regular reporting mechanisms for tracking progress toward these outcomes.

For individual project measurement:

* Use existing metrics and benchmarks for each project (e.g., number of people reached, amount of funding secured).
* Regularly review and adjust measurement approaches as needed.

**6. What sense-making processes would help?**

To facilitate sense-making:

* Conduct regular meetings between leaders/organizations working on shared outcomes.
* Develop a shared understanding of the community impact desired through these projects.
* Establish clear communication channels for sharing progress, challenges, and lessons learned.

Some specific collaboration opportunities and pathway recommendations are:

1. **Oonchiumpa** and **Maningrida - Justice Reinvestment**: Collaborate on justice-focused initiatives, with a shared goal of improving outcomes in Indigenous communities.
2. **Custodian Economy** and **AIME**: Combine resources to enhance health/wellness outcomes for vulnerable populations, using storytelling/narrative approaches.
3. **Empathy Ledger projects (QFCC, AIME, YAC)**: Facilitate connections between these projects to amplify storytelling/narrative impact across multiple platforms.

These recommendations aim to address the challenges identified by ACT's principle and provide a starting point for collaborative efforts toward shared outcomes.

## 6. PHILANTHROPY PATHWAYS

Based on the project data and shared outcomes analysis, I'll design a pathway to address the challenges faced by ACT. Here's a comprehensive plan with specific designs:

**1. OUTCOME-BASED FUNDING PATHWAYS**

To create clear pathways from funding to outcomes, group projects by shared outcomes and show how funding one outcome supports multiple community initiatives.

* **Outcome Groupings:**
	+ Justice (e.g., advocacy, policy reform)
	+ Health (e.g., access to healthcare, mental health support)
	+ Culture (e.g., arts, cultural preservation)
	+ Economic Empowerment (e.g., job training, entrepreneurship)
	+ Education (e.g., literacy, vocational training)
* **Outcome Portfolios:**
	+ Create a portfolio for each outcome grouping with multiple community initiatives
	+ Show how funding one initiative contributes to the overall outcome (e.g., funding advocacy work supports policy reform and access to healthcare)
	+ Develop case studies demonstrating collective impact across projects

**Example Outcome Portfolio: Justice**

* Project 1: Advocacy Coalition - $100,000
* Project 2: Policy Reform Initiative - $150,000
* Project 3: Community Mediation Program - $50,000
Total: $300,000 (Portfolio Value)

Funding this portfolio supports the overall outcome of achieving justice. Each project contributes to the broader impact:

* Advocacy Coalition secures policy wins for marginalized communities.
* Policy Reform Initiative informs and advocates for systemic changes.
* Community Mediation Program resolves conflicts and builds community relationships.

**2. COLLABORATIVE FUNDING MODELS**

To facilitate collaborative funding, design models that pool resources for shared outcomes while maintaining community leadership and governance.

* **Funding Models:**
	+ Philanthropic partnerships (e.g., foundation grants)
	+ Government contracts (e.g., block grants, program funding)
	+ Earned income streams (e.g., social enterprises, events)
	+ Hybrid models combining multiple sources
* **Governance Structures:**
	+ Community-led decision-making committees with representation from ACT and funders
	+ Regular check-ins and evaluations to ensure alignment with community goals
* **ACT's Role:**
	+ Facilitate collaboration and coordination among funders and community initiatives
	+ Provide technical assistance and capacity building support for community partners

**Example Collaborative Funding Model:**

* **Justice Portfolio Partnership:** ACT, Foundation A, Government Agency B, and Community C form a partnership to fund the Justice Outcome Portfolio.
* Each partner contributes $100,000 (total $400,000)
* Community-led decision-making committee ensures alignment with community goals
* Regular evaluations and check-ins ensure collective impact

**3. TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY**

To demonstrate collective impact across projects and share learnings, establish transparent metrics that matter to communities.

* **Metrics:**
	+ Number of community members reached or served
	+ Percent change in desired outcomes (e.g., access to healthcare)
	+ Community engagement and participation levels
	+ Economic benefits for local businesses and residents
* **Measurement Frameworks:**
	+ Establish a common set of metrics across projects
	+ Use participatory budgeting and community-led decision-making to prioritize funding allocations
* **Learnings and Failures:** Share open lessons learned, successes, and setbacks through regular reports and community forums

**Example Measurement Framework:**

* **Justice Portfolio Dashboard:**
	+ Number of advocacy wins secured (30)
	+ Percent increase in access to healthcare for marginalized communities (25%)
	+ Community engagement levels (75% attendance at community events)

**4. OBSOLESCENCE PATHWAY**

To support community capacity building and step back as communities lead, establish an exit strategy that acknowledges collective success.

* **Capacity Building:**
	+ Provide training and technical assistance to build community capacity
	+ Support community-led decision-making and governance structures
* **Exit Strategy:**
	+ Establish a clear plan for ACT's role in the project (e.g., 2-year transition period)
	+ Transfer ownership and leadership to the community, with ongoing support from ACT
	+ Celebrate collective success and acknowledge ACT's contribution

**Example Exit Strategy:**

* **Justice Portfolio Success:**
	+ After 3 years of collaborative funding and capacity building, ACT transfers ownership to Community C.
	+ Community C takes on decision-making roles, with ACT providing ongoing technical assistance and support.
	+ ACT celebrates the success of the Justice Outcome Portfolio, acknowledging its role in supporting community leadership.
