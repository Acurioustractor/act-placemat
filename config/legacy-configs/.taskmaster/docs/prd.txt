# ACT Life Operating System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Build a revolutionary Life Operating System that transforms daily living into an adventure, strengthening community sovereignty while making extraction more difficult. This system integrates calendar management, project tracking, financial flows, story capture, and relationship intelligence into a unified platform that respects cultural protocols and user data sovereignty.

## Vision Statement
Create the operating system for a new way of living - one that prioritizes adventure, community, and human connection over extraction and exploitation. Every feature must increase joy, strengthen sovereignty, and respect cultural protocols.

## Core Principles
- User owns all data (true sovereignty)
- Offline-first architecture (works in remote locations)
- Encryption everywhere (privacy sacred)
- Open source core (community can fork)
- API-first design (integrate with everything)
- Community-first scheduling
- Beautiful obsolescence (plan to give it all away)

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

### Morning Briefing System
Create a beautiful daily overview system that presents the day's adventures with sunrise-themed gradients, showing scheduled activities with their community impact, and providing one-click actions for preparation, navigation, and rescheduling.

### Project Constellation View
Implement a visual project management system that displays all 55 projects as interconnected stars, tracking obsolescence progress and showing relationships between initiatives.

### Voice Story Capture System
Build a voice-to-text story capture system using Whisper API for transcription, with AI-powered narrative polishing and automatic media attachment capabilities.

### Smart Calendar Integration
Develop calendar integration with Google Calendar API that prioritizes community activities, suggests optimal scheduling based on energy patterns, and automatically identifies adventure opportunities.

### Money Flow Visualization
Create a financial visualization system that integrates with Xero API, displays money flows as beautiful rivers, tracks impact-aligned spending, and suggests funding opportunities aligned with values.

### Real-time Sync Infrastructure
Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates across all devices, with PWA capabilities for offline functionality and automatic sync when connection restored.

### Database Architecture
Set up PostgreSQL for structured data, Neo4j for relationship graphs, and implement proper data models for users, projects, stories, calendar events, and financial transactions.

### Authentication and Security
Implement JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing, end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, and privacy-first data handling protocols.

### Design System Creation
Build a Tailwind-based design system with desert-inspired color palettes, smooth Framer Motion animations, and responsive layouts that work across all platforms.

## Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Months 4-6)
Add AI-powered intelligence to make the system magical and anticipatory.

### AI Companion Development
Create an intelligent life companion using Claude API that learns user values and energy patterns, understands community protocols, and suggests perfect activities based on context.

### Energy Pattern Learning
Implement system to track and learn user energy rhythms, identifying peak creativity vs focus times, and suggesting activities that match current energy levels.

### Relationship Health Monitoring
Build relationship intelligence that tracks connection frequency, nudges for important check-ins, and maintains a graph database of meaningful relationships.

### Impact Measurement System
Develop metrics to measure progress toward obsolescence goals, track community impact of activities, and visualize contribution to movement objectives.

### Financial Intelligence Engine
Create AI-powered financial analysis that suggests funding aligned with values, identifies wasteful spending patterns, and recommends resource pooling opportunities.

### Story Sovereignty Tracking
Implement system to track narrative ownership, monitor story distribution and usage, and ensure user maintains control over their narratives.

### Intelligent Scheduling Assistant
Build AI scheduler that considers energy levels, community needs, travel time between adventures, and automatically suggests optimal activity timing.

### Natural Language Interface
Develop voice and text command system allowing users to interact naturally with queries like "What should I do now?" or "Schedule time with community next week."

### Pattern Recognition System
Create machine learning models to identify user patterns, predict needs before they arise, and suggest proactive interventions for well-being.

### Community Protocol Library
Build a system to encode and respect cultural protocols, ensuring all suggestions align with community values and preventing extractive behaviors.

## Phase 3: Movement Infrastructure (Months 7-12)
Connect the global network and enable federated community collaboration.

### Distributed Architecture Implementation
Build peer-to-peer networking infrastructure using Matrix protocol for messaging, ActivityPub for social features, and IPFS for distributed story storage.

### Local Community Mesh Network
Implement local-first networking that works without internet, enables community resource sharing, and maintains privacy within trusted circles.

### Regional Network Bridges
Create systems to connect local meshes into regional networks, with selective data sharing protocols and respect for community boundaries.

### Global Movement Cloud
Build infrastructure for global coordination, aggregate impact metrics, and movement-wide resource pooling while maintaining local sovereignty.

### Federation Protocol Development
Implement protocols for cross-community collaboration, resource sharing agreements, and narrative exchange with consent.

### Encrypted Story Exchange
Create system for private story sharing with end-to-end encryption, granular access controls, and time-limited sharing capabilities.

### Resource Pooling System
Build platform for communities to share tools, knowledge, and funding, with reputation-based trust systems and fair resource allocation algorithms.

### Movement Metrics Dashboard
Develop real-time visualization of global impact, showing obsolescence progress worldwide and celebrating community achievements.

### Cultural Protocol Registry
Create a registry of cultural protocols from different communities, with automatic protocol enforcement and respectful cross-cultural interaction guidelines.

### Desert Festival 2027 Integration
Build special event mode for gatherings, with offline mesh networking capabilities and celebration of movement milestones.
