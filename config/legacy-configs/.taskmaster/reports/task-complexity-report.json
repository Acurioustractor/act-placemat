			"taskTitle": "Initialize Monorepo and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo and CI/CD setup into subtasks: (1) Select and configure Nx or Turborepo, (2) Scaffold React Native (Expo), Next.js, Electron, and Node.js projects, (3) Set up TypeScript project references for shared code, (4) Configure Prettier, ESLint, and Husky, (5) Set up Docker and Docker Compose for local development, (6) Implement GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and Docker builds, (7) Document the monorepo structure and developer onboarding, (8) Validate builds and CI/CD pipeline end-to-end.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multi-framework orchestration, advanced TypeScript configuration, and robust CI/CD automation. It requires deep knowledge of monorepo tooling, Docker, and GitHub Actions, and must ensure seamless developer experience and code quality controls. Each step is non-trivial and interdependent, justifying a high complexity and granular breakdown."
