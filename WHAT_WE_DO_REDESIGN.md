# Redesigning "WHAT We Do" - More Nuance & Impact

## Current Problem
The current "WHAT" section is too simple:
- Just lists themes with counts
- Doesn't show the **intersectionality** of the work
- Doesn't communicate **why** this matters
- Misses the **complexity** and **sophistication** of ACT's approach

## Better Approach: "Weaving Narratives of Change"

Instead of just themes, show:
1. **What the work actually IS** (with concrete examples)
2. **How themes intersect** (most projects span multiple themes)
3. **The deeper purpose** (not just "storytelling" but "community-controlled narratives")
4. **Real outcomes** (what changes because of this work)

## New Design Concepts

### Option 1: **Thematic Layers** (Onion Model)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         OUTER LAYER: What People See            │
│  [Storytelling] [Youth Programs] [Health]      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         MIDDLE LAYER: What's Really Happening   │
│  → Building Community Voice                      │
│  → Disrupting Justice Pipelines                 │
│  → Healing Through Culture                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         CORE: What Changes                       │
│  Power shifts to communities                     │
│  Self-determination strengthens                  │
│  Systems become obsolete                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Option 2: **Intersection Matrix** (Shows Overlap)

```
Most projects work across MULTIPLE themes:

    Storytelling × Youth Justice × Culture
         ↓
    "Youth-led cultural narratives disrupting
     the justice pipeline" (BG Fit, PICC)

    Health × Culture × Economic Freedom
         ↓
    "Wellness as cultural practice generating
     community wealth" (Witta Harvest)
```

### Option 3: **Theory of Change Visualization**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WHAT WE DO                                   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                               │
│  🎭 Community-Controlled Storytelling         │
│     Not just stories, but WHO owns them       │
│     → 52 storytellers activated               │
│     → Communities control their narrative     │
│                                               │
│  ⚖️ Disrupting Justice Pipelines             │
│     Not just youth programs, but systemic     │
│     → On-country healing vs. incarceration   │
│     → Cultural connection as intervention     │
│                                               │
│  🌱 Regenerative Economics                    │
│     Not just income, but self-determination   │
│     → $XXX,XXX in community hands             │
│     → Local wealth creation, not extraction   │
│                                               │
│  🏥 Cultural Wellness                         │
│     Health through connection to country      │
│     → Traditional knowledge + modern care     │
│     → Communities as health experts           │
│                                               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Option 4: **Project Spotlights** (Show Real Work)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WHAT WE DO: Real Work, Real Impact          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                               │
│  🎙️ Community Storytelling (26 projects)    │
│     Example: PICC Storm Stories               │
│     "Palm Island documenting resilience       │
│      after storms - their stories, their      │
│      terms, their platform"                   │
│                                               │
│  🏃 Youth Justice Disruption (15 projects)   │
│     Example: BG Fit                           │
│     "On-country fitness camps replacing       │
│      justice system with cultural healing"    │
│                                               │
│  🌾 Regenerative Economics (10 projects)     │
│     Example: Witta Harvest HQ                 │
│     "Food sovereignty generating local        │
│      wealth while honoring Country"           │
│                                               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Recommended: **"Threads of Change"**

Show themes as **interconnected threads** that weave together:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  HOW OUR WORK WEAVES TOGETHER                    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🧵 Thread 1: Community Voice & Sovereignty
   ├─ Storytelling (26 projects)
   │  └─ Communities control their narratives
   ├─ Cultural Preservation (13 projects)
   │  └─ Indigenous knowledge systems honored
   └─ Data Sovereignty
      └─ All project data owned by communities

🧵 Thread 2: Disrupting Harmful Systems
   ├─ Youth Justice (15 projects)
   │  └─ Cultural healing replaces incarceration
   ├─ Health & Wellbeing (19 projects)
   │  └─ Connection to Country as medicine
   └─ Economic Freedom (10 projects)
      └─ Local wealth vs. extraction

🧵 Thread 3: Building Regenerative Futures
   ├─ Operations (10 projects)
   │  └─ Infrastructure for self-determination
   ├─ Enterprise Development
   │  └─ Community-led economic models
   └─ Knowledge Sharing
      └─ Communities teaching communities

These threads interweave in every project:
→ BG Fit = Youth + Justice + Culture + Health
→ PICC Storm Stories = Storytelling + Culture + Resilience
→ Witta Harvest = Economics + Health + Culture + Sovereignty
```

## What This Communicates Better:

1. **Complexity** - ACT's work isn't siloed into categories
2. **Sophistication** - This is systems-change work, not services
3. **Intersectionality** - Everything connects to everything
4. **Purpose** - Not doing youth programs, disrupting pipelines
5. **Power** - Communities at center, controlling their futures
6. **Obsolescence** - Building capacity that makes ACT unnecessary

---

## Alternative Framings

Instead of just theme names, use **action phrases**:

❌ "Storytelling"
✅ "Communities Own Their Narratives"

❌ "Youth Justice"
✅ "Disrupting the School-to-Prison Pipeline"

❌ "Health and Wellbeing"
✅ "Healing Through Connection to Country"

❌ "Economic Freedom"
✅ "Building Regenerative Local Economies"

❌ "Indigenous"
✅ "First Nations Leadership & Sovereignty"

---

## Which Direction Resonates?

1. **Thematic Layers** - Shows surface vs. deeper work
2. **Intersection Matrix** - Highlights how themes overlap
3. **Theory of Change** - Shows WHAT → HOW → IMPACT
4. **Project Spotlights** - Real examples bring it alive
5. **Threads of Change** - Weaving metaphor

Let me know which feels right and I'll build it!
