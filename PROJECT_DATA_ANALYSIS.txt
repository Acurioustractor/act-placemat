📊 ACT PLACEMAT PROJECT DATA ANALYSIS
Generated from Mock Data
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
The app is currently using MOCK DATA because there's no backend server running.
To use real Notion data, you'll need to either:
1. Set up a backend API server to connect to Notion
2. Or use Notion's API directly from the frontend

For now, here's what the mock data shows:

💡 TO USE YOUR REAL NOTION DATA
================================================================================

The app is designed to work with Notion, but needs a backend server to do so.

Current Architecture:
  Frontend (React) → Backend API → Notion API → Your Notion Databases

Missing Piece: Backend API server

OPTIONS:

Option 1: Simple Notion Integration (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------
I can help you create a simple Express.js backend that:
- Connects directly to your Notion databases
- Provides the API endpoints the frontend expects
- Handles authentication securely

This would take about 15-20 minutes to set up.

Option 2: Use Notion API Directly (Quick but less secure)
---------------------------------------------------------
Modify the frontend to call Notion API directly:
- Faster to set up (5 minutes)
- But exposes your Notion API key in the browser
- Not recommended for production

Option 3: Use the Showcase with What You Have
---------------------------------------------
- The smart data mapper works with ANY project data
- You can manually create a few test projects
- Add descriptions with numbers and see auto-extraction work
- Then deploy with real backend later

================================================================================
🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Tell me which option you prefer:
   a) Set up backend server (15-20 min, secure, production-ready)
   b) Quick frontend-only setup (5 min, testing only)
   c) Just see the showcase working with mock data first

2. Once connected to Notion, you'll be able to:
   ✅ See all your real projects
   ✅ Use the Project Analysis Dashboard
   ✅ View auto-extraction working on your descriptions
   ✅ See which projects are showcase-ready
   ✅ Get specific recommendations for each project

3. The Smart Data Mapping will automatically:
   ✅ Extract numbers from descriptions ("50 people" → stats)
   ✅ Find testimonial quotes
   ✅ Generate hero images from defaults
   ✅ Create SEO-friendly slugs
   ✅ Suggest appropriate CTAs

================================================================================

Let me know which approach you'd like to take!
