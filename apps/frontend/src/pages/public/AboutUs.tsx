              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p className="public-story-lead">
                Born from the recognition that Australia's greatest challenges 
                require collaborative solutions, the ACT Platform emerged as a 
                bridge between individual passion and collective impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, a diverse group of community organizers, social entrepreneurs, 
                and everyday champions realized that while there was no shortage of 
                people wanting to create positive change, there was a significant 
                gap in connecting these changemakers with each other and with 
                meaningful opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built the ACT Platform to be more than just another networking 
                tool. It's a movement catalyst—a place where stories meet systems, 
                where individual energy becomes collective power, and where good 
                intentions transform into measurable impact.

              <p>
                The ACT Platform operates on a simple but powerful principle: 
                meaningful change happens when the right people connect around 
                the right opportunities at the right time.

                  <p>
                    Many powerful collaborations never happen because potential 
                    partners don't know each other exists. We make these connections visible.

                    platforms that help local leaders share their knowledge and solutions.

                    Good ideas shouldn't die because of administrative hurdles or 
                    resource gaps. We help turn inspiration into implementation.

                    and share their progress in ways that build trust and improve outcomes.
