# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Moved to act-ecosystem

**This repository has been merged into [act-ecosystem](https://github.com/Acurioustractor/act-ecosystem)**

## What Happened

As part of the V2 architecture consolidation (2026-01-26), this repository was merged with `act-global-infrastructure` into a unified mono-repo called `act-ecosystem`.

## New Location

All code from this repository now lives in:

```
https://github.com/Acurioustractor/act-ecosystem
```

### Directory Mapping

| Old Location | New Location |
|--------------|--------------|
| `apps/frontend/` | `apps/intelligence/` |
| `apps/backend/` | `apps/command-center/` (merged) |

## Why?

1. **Simplified development** - One repo for all internal operations
2. **Shared code** - Easier to share types and utilities
3. **Unified CI/CD** - Single pipeline for backend + dashboard
4. **Better safeguards** - Consolidated Claude Code protections

## Do Not Use This Repo

- No new commits should be made here
- Use `act-ecosystem` for all future work
- This repo is kept for historical reference only

## Quick Start with New Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Acurioustractor/act-ecosystem.git
cd act-ecosystem
npm install
npm run dev:api        # Command Center at http://localhost:3456
npm run dev:dashboard  # Intelligence at http://localhost:3999
```
