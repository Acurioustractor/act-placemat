The initiative aims to empower Indigenous youth through culturally grounded fitness and mentorship, addressing the overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in the justice system. The program includes pre-camp fitness sessions, annual on-country camps, and post-camp recovery, fostering resilience and cultural identity. Key partnerships with local Elders, police, and community organizations support its goals, with a vision for full community ownership by 2027.","status":"Active 🔥","projectLead":{"id":"08c7478b-1bfc-42c3-97e4-294975af3996","name":"Benjamin Knight","avatarUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.notion-static.com/230063a8-57ec-4f21-99b4-c2e198e76577/AIME_BK-1.jpg","type":"person"},"lead":"Benjamin Knight","actualIncoming":30000,"potentialIncoming":50000,"revenueActual":20000,"revenuePotential":20000,"totalFunding":77000,"partnerCount":0,"supporters":0,"coreValues":"Decentralised Power","theme":["Youth Justice"],"themes":["Youth Justice"],"tags":["Empathy Ledger","Health","justice"],"relationshipPillars":[],"nextMilestoneDate":"2025-09-19","location":"","relatedFields":[],"relatedActions":["190ebcf9-81cf-804c-97aa-df0da5c768d7","191ebcf9-81cf-801a-89d4-c4490e77910c","196ebcf9-81cf-80a7-9492-ccb12d3653f1","196ebcf9-81cf-8027-ab1e-c39fe0095ad1","196ebcf9-81cf-80e7-853e-d827eda8a725","196ebcf9-81cf-8019-a9f4-c8bf99ea01c1","199ebcf9-81cf-8031-91bc-f16e1b4d15ab","1b8ebcf9-81cf-8080-880a-e485480cf034","1c7ebcf9-81cf-807c-b3e6-fa98ee7e15e1","1cfebcf9-81cf-8030-8f2a-fe32cd272661","1d0ebcf9-81cf-80c6-af70-f3253d716296","1d0ebcf9-81cf-80cb-aa3a-d910d4cec6a2","1d0ebcf9-81cf-805c-8b3e-ce66de0e3e9c","1d0ebcf9-81cf-80e5-9b68-ea15427788af","1d0ebcf9-81cf-8065-a78d-d4e8ac15fb80","1d0ebcf9-81cf-8048-af30-e250a2bcb4ee","1d2ebcf9-81cf-8026-bf2e-f0312bca0f96","1d2ebcf9-81cf-801e-9b20-e062edf6df42","1d2ebcf9-81cf-8077-9553-ed01ce8b75ff","1e2ebcf9-81cf-80ab-9056-e376f5752ee2","213ebcf9-81cf-8095-8871-c945364b8358","228ebcf9-81cf-8096-9e23-fbb3a02c42eb","228ebcf9-81cf-8095-b741-d76418fe7fc7","22bebcf9-81cf-80ab-8f63-f3c512acae17","22bebcf9-81cf-8059-89ed-d6d678048f8c"],"relatedResources":[],"relatedArtifacts":[],"relatedConversations":[],"relatedOpportunities":["237ebcf9-81cf-8062-b2c1-e3f105ac02de","237ebcf9-81cf-8084-a968-d705bbea8103","237ebcf9-81cf-809d-858d-fb3f04c20ab6"],"relatedOrganisations":[],"relatedPlaces":[{"indigenousName":"Kalkadoon","westernName":"Mount Isa","displayName":"Kalkadoon","map":"-20.7256,139.4927","state":"Qld"}],"fieldInboxToBeSorted":null,"area":"Decentralised Power","featured":false,"startDate":null,"endDate":"2025-09-19","budget":30000,"funding":"$30000K actual, 50000K potential","updatedAt":"2025-09-10T02:53:00.000Z","notionUrl":"https://www.notion.so/BG-Fit-18febcf981cf80fea738fe374e01cd08","notionId":"18febcf9-81cf-80fe-a738-fe374e01cd08","notionIdShort":"18febcf981cf80fea738fe374e01cd08","notionCreatedAt":"2025-02-03T21:54:00.000Z","notionLastEditedAt":"2025-09-10T02:53:00.000Z","coverImage":"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5496da29-0ded-443b-9f03-cf928ea15566/e9f03873-a469-4331-8816-b784743dd9d0/20250710-IMG_8667.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466ZSPRBNMP%2F20251025%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251025T010516Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjELH%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDKpITEsEJzN5%2FtUxHbYyKcksx%2F33p6L9S8DXrI0pWsawIhAMJvhOuxbgnhHkPQ5ORYkp6e9%2BSo4Er7g9%2F2Cz0pHATbKv8DCGoQABoMNjM3NDIzMTgzODA1Igw8Tr%2F%2BSNj3p67GseYq3AP52NcO%2BWfLNgP1Yo5Xe%2FmWNCCx630aSOSypLKQe3cGLxi%2FKwu%2FHHsBm1K%2FDQbDEcU9pxn3G53o%2BIaphCxzQ0SGpew1hQ7eyJB9pJJZnS1Ot2C5pGurgjbK88QrneXmZH6n1uJBgHhx6D%2Bbz5%2F3k%2FfP41ZUELoZsOtYK4f%2FbRHsKvmM7BuGvQHmyqcE7A0SMCTEGpU1rqK%2Bq5657zCsCAO0BLAkjVX%2FNc3KXHqf8PkJk%2BRAVN30jStNwIQi3RNMzsxGkKupVYmm%2Fan32Mh%2BBLqSvUEjZuRQ2QowyRSTehzATpbWns0yC9moi5KEw9YrfJpM%2Fut1urU3tUADvuwGsP4MsUqDKnlAaNrGmOJReWgQE9ywvfdT%2FMzKR%2BPhQy6Iy3esiea6mla1HzXYYAgotUYTeIZwnJ7j74BTdnVRjUIqosrLf8b8ia4ijbt2hyTHoXIvGhnW4PgwrccDpc4ybV5yzb6Ce0Q8vQxxOxOoMVq2g6mdLsg1LNmkdDrgE5HVkSHe990i4h84I2LH4%2BPa3qsEaKL1ivSJquyoL%2FYRX3FGwFvy6UOtWhTVtrSnoDTZ6ipKsRj6crLtK%2B%2Ff4n%2BwL6vqOfuHrT9FAxolALOb%2BUA%2FRAdH4yrOAk3OPat9%2BTDCs%2FDHBjqkAfIbmEgHWchiZb%2FWSFIAy39NrjpxkDt7Ohx9rPIv6nhCLtN%2BvVJCfJirH0r2Drgh%2BngojP6GYPrcWLxQyALPdAQNFoAHfzQze9Fhsvf5yJmZj7ks5ndrQOr%2FKn%2BDn4CtW2xSIP5qTy8tGFFTR%2BAHVn%2FiZi8s2HHvtqqbqNSJ41spWjIfkrS5PiuBkN1jgCVWBoggl42VNXZFT9LcMY8vcXmJiBJ6&X-Amz-Signature=c14ae7759308355e834929181f655b06cd5506dcbc7b960010263fd78e086952&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject","title":"BG Fit","supabaseProjectId":null,"supabaseProject":null,"storytellers":[],"storytellerCount":0},{"id":"18febcf9-81cf-80f5-bb14-dc8229b66f4e","name":"Bimberi - Holiday Programs","aiSummary":"The project aims to empower Indigenous-led initiatives in Australia by providing governance support, mobilizing resources, and fostering community-led solutions.
