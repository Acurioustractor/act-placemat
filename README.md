## 🌱 **Our Vision**

**"Where story meets system. Evidence you can feel—and fund."**

ACT is building the infrastructure for a **community-owned economy** where authentic relationships, ethical technology, and grassroots wisdom form the foundation of sustainable change. We don't serve communities—we provide tools that communities can own, control, and eventually operate independently.

**The revolution is community-led. The tools are ready. The time is now.**
