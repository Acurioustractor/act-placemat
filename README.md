# ACT Platform - Community-Owned Impact Platform

## The World's First Community-Owned Impact Platform

A Curious Tractor is building revolutionary technology that serves community ownership rather than institutional convenience. Our goal is **Beautiful Obsolescence** - where communities no longer need ACT because they have complete control of their own platforms and futures.

- **📋 Compliance Tracking** - BAS, PAYG, Superannuation, R&D Tax Incentives
- **🎯 Grant Discovery** - Automatic scanning of grants.gov.au and Indigenous programs
- **🤝 Relationship Intelligence** - LinkedIn network analysis (4,491 contacts)

### Features

```
User: "What's my BAS obligation?"
Agent: "Your next BAS is due October 28 (in 28 days):
        - GST collected: $12,400
        - GST paid: $8,200
        - Net payable: $4,200
        Would you like me to schedule a payment reminder?"

User: "Are there grants I should apply for?"
Agent: "I found 3 relevant opportunities:
        1. Indigenous Business Direct ($50K-$250K) - Due in 6 weeks
        2. R&D Tax Incentive (38.5% of $120K = $46K benefit)
        3. Entrepreneurs' Programme (up to $1M) - Rolling

        I recommend the R&D Tax Incentive first.
        Your tech development qualifies. Want me to draft it?"

## 💡 Philosophy: Beautiful Obsolescence

Our ultimate success metric is **Beautiful Obsolescence** - communities saying:

> "ACT? We don't need them anymore. We run this ourselves now."

We're not building dependency. We're building **community power**.

Communities don't need external saviors - they need:
- ✅ Superior tools
- ✅ Authentic partnerships
- ✅ Systems designed for their ownership
