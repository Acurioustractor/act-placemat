## Outreach Sequences (Sprint 1)

Owner: Ben  
Due: End of Week 1  
Related Task: 14.12 — Lead sources and outreach sequences

Principles
- Personalize by segment/persona using ICP insights  
- Keep steps short, value-first, with a clear next action  
- One CTA per message; light on attachments; link to one‑pager when asked  
- Stop on strong No; pause after meeting booked

Cadence (3 steps over ~10 business days)
1) Day 1 — Intro value (email/DM)  
2) Day 5 — Relevance nudge with proof (email/DM)  
3) Day 10 — Close loop & offer quick win (email/DM or call/voice note)

Templates (email)
Step 1 — Intro value
Subject: Quick way to get receipts + finance summary live this week
Body:
Hi {{first_name}},

We help {{segment}} teams run finance ops and weekly reviews from one surface.
- Auto-capture receipts from Gmail, live Xero summary
- Weekly decision review with alerts for risks/opportunities

Would a 15‑min walkthrough help to see if this fits {{company}}?
Cheers, Ben

Step 2 — Relevance nudge
Subject: {{company}} — keeping cash/runway in view (no extra tools)
Body:
Hi {{first_name}},

For {{persona}} at {{segment}}, the usual pain is manual bookkeeping + scattered tools. We integrate Xero/Gmail/Notion you already use, so you see cash, receipts, and actions weekly.
Two screenshots and a 2‑min demo available. Want me to send?
Best,
Ben

Step 3 — Close loop / quick win
Subject: Close loop — 1‑click receipts sweep + finance snapshot?
Body:
Hi {{first_name}},

If now’s not the time, I’ll pause. If helpful, we can run a 1‑day pilot: connect Xero/Gmail, show your finance summary and recent receipts, and propose a 30/60/90 plan.
Worth a look?
Ben

LinkedIn DM variants
- Keep to 300–400 chars; mirror email content; offer screenshot/demo on reply.

Call/voice note script (60s)
- Problem → Outcome → Small ask  
- “We unify Xero + Gmail into a weekly finance view and automate receipts. Can I send a 2‑min demo and book 15 minutes if it resonates?”

Sequencing rules
- Use CRM task reminders; stop sequence on reply/meeting  
- Don’t sequence more than 2 channels in the same day  
- Add notes and objections to CRM for learning

Lead sources (initial)
- Warm intros, partner networks, relevant communities, previous collaborators, targeted LinkedIn lists, ecosystem guilds.

Metrics to track
- Reply rate, meeting rate, conversion to discovery, time‑to‑proposal, wins.
