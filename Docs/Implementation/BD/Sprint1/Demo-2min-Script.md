## 2‑Minute Demo Script (Sprint 1)

Owner: Ben  
Related Task: 14.13 — Sales collateral v1

Goal
- Show value in under 2 minutes using real flows: receipts → finance summary → weekly actions.

Structure (120s)
0–15s: Context
- "We unify Xero, Gmail, and Notion so you see receipts, cash/runway, and weekly actions in one place."

15–45s: Receipts capture (Gmail)
- Open receipts list (latest sweep)  
- "We auto-detect receipts/invoices from Gmail and normalize key info (amount, vendor, date, links)."

45–80s: Finance summary (Xero)
- Open /finance summary  
- "Live view of cash, receivables/payables, and runway with alerts and suggestions."

80–105s: Weekly review (Decision Intelligence)
- Open DI dashboard  
- "Run a quick weekly review: risks, opportunities, and recommended actions."

105–120s: Next step
- "We can connect on your data in a 1‑day pilot: receipts + finance summary live, and a 30/60/90 plan."

Common variants
- Finance‑heavy: spend more time on receivables/payables and runway thresholds  
- Ops‑heavy: emphasize alerts, suggestions, and automated checklists

FAQ prompts
- Data scopes & privacy  
- Setup time and rollout  
- Pricing tiers and implementation fees
