## Value Propositions and Messaging (Sprint 1)

Owner: Ben  
Due: End of Week 1  
Related Task: 14.9 — Craft value propositions and messaging

Core proposition
- Operate your community-driven business from one intelligent surface. Automate receipts, see cash/runway, make better decisions weekly, and scale programs without adding headcount.

Tiered value props (by maturity)
- Starter: "See what matters weekly" — live finance summary (Xero), receipt capture (Gmail), simple dashboards, decision check-ins
- Growth: "Automate ops and reviews" — CRM views, program boards, DI research/scenarios, proactive alerts, partner-ready onboarding
- Partner: "Deliver at scale" — multi-tenant patterns, shared artifacts, compliance frameworks, KPI reporting, enablement kits

Proof points (to collect during Sprint 1–2)
- Setup time under 1 day with existing Google/Xero/Notion
- Finance summary and receipts live within minutes (post-consent)
- Weekly DI review drives measurable action items and risk reduction

Messaging angles
- Replace busywork with intelligent assistants (Finance Copilot, DI)
- Keep cash healthy: receipts in, invoices out, runway in view
- Ethical, interoperable data design built for communities and partners

Objections → Responses
- "We already have tools." → We integrate and unify; keep what works, automate the gaps
- "AI risk/security." → Minimal data scope, auditable flows, opt-in privacy controls
- "Too early for us." → Starter tier gives value day one; upgrade when ready
