## ICP and Segmentation (Sprint 1)

Owner: Ben  
Due: End of Week 1  
Related Task: 14.8 — Define ICP and segmentation

Segments (initial hypothesis)
- Community-first SMEs and startups building member programs or local ecosystems
- Nonprofits/collectives with community operations and reporting needs
- Agencies/partners delivering community projects for multiple clients
- Co-ops and guilds needing transparent, ethical operations and shared tooling

Primary personas
- Founder/GM (P&L, strategic outcomes)
- Ops/Finance Lead (cash, invoicing, reconciliation, compliance)
- Community Lead (member growth, engagement, communications)
- Technical Lead (integration quality, data reliability, security)

Pains
- Fragmented tools; manual bookkeeping; poor visibility of cash/runway
- Hard to coordinate projects, decisions, and documentation across apps
- Lack of timely alerts on risks/opportunities (receipts, invoices, renewals)
- Compliance and data-sharing friction across stakeholders

Gains
- Single operational surface with intelligent assistants (Finance Copilot, DI)
- Automated capture (Gmail receipts) and finance summaries (Xero)
- Decision intelligence powering planning, reviews, and alerts
- Repeatable onboarding/processes for scale and partner delivery

Buying triggers
- Preparing for growth/funding; need reliable metrics and dashboards
- CFO/Bookkeeper transition; tooling consolidation initiative
- New program/collective launch requiring interoperable tooling
- Audit/compliance pressure; desire for ethical data practices

Deal sizes (guidance; validate Week 2)
- Implementation: £2k–£8k depending on scope and integrations
- Platform subscription: £250–£1,500/mo across tiers (Starter/Growth/Partner)
- Optional add-ons: AI research packs, advanced analytics, partner enablement

Qualification checklist (expanded)
- Tooling access: Xero, Gmail, Notion (admin-level for setup)
- Clear owner(s): BD/Ops lead identified for onboarding window
- Priority workflow: at least one high-impact process to automate in Sprint 2 (e.g., receipt capture → reconciliation)
- Data cadence: weekly/bi-weekly decision ritual agreed
- Security: basic data-sharing/privacy preferences confirmed
- Success metric: 30/60/90-day outcomes defined (cash visibility, cycle-time, pipeline health)

Disqualifiers (for now)
- No access to required connectors (Xero/Gmail/Notion)
- No executive/ops owner available during onboarding window
- No recurring decision cadence or unwillingness to adopt one

Target list (prioritized v1)

  1. Prospect A — Referrer: [name]; Segment: SME; Status: to contact
  2. Prospect B — Referrer: [name]; Segment: Collective; Status: to contact
- Category B (Impact/community orgs: local networks/co-ops)
  3. Prospect C — Network: [name]; Segment: Nonprofit; Status: research
  4. Prospect D — Co-op: [name]; Segment: Co-op; Status: research
  5. Prospect E — Program: [name]; Segment: Community; Status: research
- Category C (Agencies/partners delivering multi-client programs)
  6. Prospect F — Agency: [name]; Clients: [n]; Status: discovery
  7. Prospect G — Agency: [name]; Clients: [n]; Status: discovery
  8. Prospect H — Partner: [name]; Region: [x]; Status: discovery
- Category D (Allied ecosystems / guilds)
  9. Prospect I — Guild: [name]; Focus: [x]; Status: to contact
  10. Prospect J — Federation: [name]; Focus: [x]; Status: to contact

Discovery questions (use in Week 1 calls)
- What are the top 2–3 recurring operational headaches each week?
- Who needs what information, how often, and in what format?
- What would make the next 90 days feel like a win for Finance/Ops?
- Which workflows would you automate first if it took 1 day to set up?

Notes
- Validate assumptions via 5–10 discovery calls. Update this doc with real data.
