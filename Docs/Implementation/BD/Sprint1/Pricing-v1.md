Owner: Ben  
Due: Mid Week 2  
Related Task: 14.10 — Pricing model v1 and discount policy

Objectives
- Publish initial pricing tiers and packaging aligned to ICP segments and value props
- Define discount guardrails and approval rules to protect margin and consistency

Tiers (draft)
- Starter (£250/mo): Finance summary, receipt capture, DI weekly review, basic dashboards
- Growth (£650/mo): CRM views, proactive alerts, scenario research, onboarding templates, partner-lite
- Partner (£1,500/mo): Multi-tenant enablement, compliance/reporting packs, advanced analytics, SLA

Packaging notes
- Users: up to 5 (Starter), 15 (Growth), 40+ (Partner)
- Data connectors: Gmail, Xero, Notion (all tiers)
- Add-ons: AI research packs, custom dashboards, data migrations

Implementation fees (guidance)
- Starter: £2k setup (1–2 weeks)
- Growth: £4k–£6k setup (2–4 weeks)
- Partner: £8k+ setup (scope-based)

Discount policy (guardrails)
- Standard: up to 10% with BD approval
- Strategic (nonprofit/partner lighthouse): up to 20% with leadership approval and case-study clause
- Annual prepay: 10% incentive (stack rules apply)

Approval rules
- >10% requires written justification; >20% requires leadership sign-off
- Any custom terms recorded in contract notes and CRM

Next steps
- Validate pricing with 3 prospects in Week 2
- Document common bundles and discount scenarios

Feature matrix (v1)
- Starter: receipts sweep (manual/weekly), finance summary, DI weekly review, standard alerts, core Notion templates
- Growth: + proactive alerts, scenario analysis (2/mo), CRM pipeline views, onboarding kits, basic partner enablement
- Partner: + multi-tenant ops, compliance/reporting packs, advanced analytics, priority support, uptime/SLA

Usage/metering assumptions
- Fair use: 5k emails scanned/mo (Starter), 20k (Growth), 60k+ (Partner)
- DI compute: 50 prompts/mo (Starter), 200 (Growth), custom (Partner)
- Overages: priced per block; cap or auto-upgrade rules to be defined

Bundling examples
- Starter + Research Pack (£150/mo): adds 2 deep-dive DI studies/mo
- Growth + Compliance Pack (£250/mo): adds reporting templates and audits
- Partner + Enablement (£500/mo): adds partner ops kits and training

SLA (Partner)
- Support: 4h response, 24h resolution target (business hours)
- Uptime target: 99.5%; planned maintenance windows announced 72h prior

Contract assumptions
- Term: monthly; annual available with 10% prepay discount
- Notice: 30 days
- Data: export on termination; privacy commitments per Compliance doc

Pricing rationale
- Anchored to time saved in weekly ops + bookkeeping + decision reviews
- Tiers map to complexity (single org → multi-client/partner delivery)

Open questions to validate (Week 2)
- Is Growth price sensitivity high for nonprofits/collectives? Consider NFP tier
- What overage thresholds are most common across prospects?
- Which add-ons convert best in discovery (research vs compliance vs enablement)?
