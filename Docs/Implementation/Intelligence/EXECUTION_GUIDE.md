### "How do we know it works?"
"FRRR won $50K last month. Plus 30-day money-back guarantee."

2. Generate payment link (recommend $500 pilot)
3. Send immediately via email

### When They Hesitate:
1. Offer $500 pilot instead of $2,000

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Platform must be running** during demos
2. **Test each query** before showing
3. **Focus on urgency** - grants are closing
4. **Lead with pilot offer** - easier yes
5. **Get payment same day** - momentum matters

---

## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK

### Platform Issues:
- Port conflict? Kill process: `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9`
- Then restart: `node src/index.js`

### Demo Issues:
- Queries slow? Pre-run them before demo
- Can't answer question? "Let me research that and get back to you today"

### Payment Issues:
- They want invoice? Use payment-processor.html generator
- Want to pay later? "Grant deadlines won't wait - let's start with $500"
