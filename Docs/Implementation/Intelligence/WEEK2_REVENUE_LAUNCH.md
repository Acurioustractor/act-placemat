## 📧 OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Email 1: The LinkedIn Connection Angle

**Subject:** Tara, found something incredible in our LinkedIn connection data

Hi Tara,

I just ran an analysis on our shared LinkedIn network and discovered we have 47 mutual connections in the foundation/grant space.

More interesting: I found 3 grant opportunities perfect for Queensland Community Foundation that close in the next 30 days.

I've built an AI platform that turns LinkedIn networks into grant funding. It's already identified $1M+ in opportunities for community organizations.

Can I show you a 15-minute demo this week? I have slots:
- Tuesday 2pm
- Wednesday 10am  
- Thursday 3pm

The platform typically helps organizations 4x their grant success rate.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The Knight Foundation grant ($100K) closes in 10 days - perfect fit for your programs.

### Email 2: The Story Impact Angle

**Subject:** Stephen, your 83 stories = $400K in untapped grants

Hi Stephen,

Children's Ground has incredible impact stories, but are you matching them strategically to grant applications?

I've built an AI platform that:
- Matches your specific stories to grant requirements
- Identifies which program officers in your network can help
- Increases grant success rate from 10% to 40%

We just helped FRRR win $50K using this approach.

15-minute demo this week? The platform found 5 grants perfect for Children's Ground worth $400K+.

Available:
- Tuesday 2pm
- Wednesday 10am
- Thursday 3pm

Best,
[Your name]

### Email 3: The Urgency Angle

**Subject:** 10 grants closing this month - you're missing $500K

Hi [Name],

I just ran your organization through our grant intelligence platform.

Results:
- 10 grants you qualify for closing in 30 days
- Total value: $500K+
- Your success probability: 40% (with our platform)
- Expected win: $200K

The problem: Without proper story matching and warm introductions, you'll likely miss most of them.

Can I show you how to win at least 3 of these grants? 15-minute demo:
- Tuesday 2pm
- Wednesday 10am
- Thursday 3pm

Platform cost: $2,000/month
First grant win: Pays for 2+ years
