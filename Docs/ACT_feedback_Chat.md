It's pretty, it's pretty good, right? Like, um, it's just that, um. It's the practice and it's just like habit and then coming back to it as well. Because it's so interesting right how like you built that system and now there's like Fuck, everything's gonna break, brother, in terms of showing your shit, but we'll just roll with resistance. It's like... I think I just gotta get a bit better at, um...

What's the push day and what's the testing space and what's the... yeah, I still haven't nailed that yet. Yeah. So we're going to start in Notion if that's alright. Yeah. Can you see my screen? No. Yep. Oh you can. I hate how Zoom has that little window where you can still see.

So, there's 1, 2, 3, 4 databases, and then each of these are linked. And then I'm trying to work out the least amount of entry points that you need to enter to be able to build out the full script. So each of these is a current opportunity. They're all linked to a project. They're all linked to an organisation who's supporting. Team members are linked and there's some processes there to get better at that.

There's a stage, there's an amount, there's a probability, there's the next actions and then there's artifacts. So there's like a people table which... I'm getting closer to working out how that can be like an automated scraping process across things to help that. Organizations should be pretty simple. It's just an organization and then you link it.

And then Artifacts, which I'm pumped about, is like, how do you create one artifact for each project? And then this... Turns into...

This, you see that? Yeah, and so this is like a dashboard that rolls everything up and then you've got your areas here And so this, across 42 projects, that's like revenue that's coming in and under it sits the potential revenue, opportunities and organisations.

where it's at where it reaches and this little pipeline thing and then each each project has its own sort of place so You've got active projects, goods, tells you like thematics, place. Vocation summaries and it should have partners as well and then it's got a financial overview. And so then you got

A list of opportunities, which is weighted around deadlines and processes and things.

This is like the people thing, so hopefully what will happen is we'll get to a stage where we can have like specific people that are linked to a project, linked to an opportunity, and then like link back to how they support, whatever. And this is the, I'm still working on this, but there's these automation things you can trigger which is like...

If you get an email from this person, it adds to their profile. And you can almost get suggestions in terms of like, you haven't talked to this person in two weeks. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. So this is all like first go, like some of this stuff. The thing I get worried about is like, is it weighted too much on money? Is it weighted too little on relations?

That's the kind of shit I'm thinking about at the moment. And then, what it should do...

Which one is it?

Thanks, friends.

So mate, the amount of fucking different servers I've got, local servers I've got running at the moment is like...

Because it should, if this works properly, I set this up, I should be able to go to this site. If I click on this, see how it's got like internal and public? I should, this, that goes to the fucking backend. Because it's a piece of shit. But anyway, that's like our dashboard and that links to our front-end website. Which links to Notion, which then builds the page essentially.

Yeah, so that's like, um, I think that's almost like, um,

It's our beta site to work out if that works and then we choose like Sean for example to test that with him in terms of like using Empathy Ledger to build his site to then look at opportunities.

So this is a priority for this week, for Wednesday. So essentially it's like, how can I get... this front-end site to a stage where I can go into QFCC and have a one and a half hour presentation on what the opportunity is for them to use this. And so there's like a heap of different like areas, but I want to try and work out what's like the one.

Specific area, for example, like this organization area, where they can see that they're a government agency that can use this for...

I was trying to work out what's like the curious tractor case study that's on here that shows a challenge, a solution, and the results. What features of the platform. It is available to use right now and what is a problem that solves for them. And then what is this implementation journey, which is how do I go from yes, I want Empathy Ledger to yes, I do.

He's the actual shit that we do. From the assessment, to designing how they collect a story, to knowing about the privacy, to engaging with the community. to having an analytics dashboard to then like sharing that publicly, I guess. So for me it's working out like...

What are the expertise that we bring that solves that problem for them? And then, like, how does that link with the MPLedger principles and practices? What's almost like the best insight that I can provide, like, I think this module page is cool, like trying to nail that in terms of what are the modules they can use.

at QCC to make sure that they are supporting the kids, getting the right messaging, and having things that they can share. So that's those two things. I'll stop there for a sec. Yeah, super cool. Um... And the one thing to frame this in Nikko is like, I've literally gone like this, you know what I mean? Yeah.

So just working out, like, what's the process for, yeah, bringing that, writing that in. Yeah. Which... I don't know, maybe this is too, like... I feel like it's not helpful when we're both, like, one... Like, you're in the tools. Building and working, and I'm like, I'm the compiler. And obviously we need to, we can't be like, one can't be converging if one's diverging all the time.

But, I think... Yeah, I think, like, fucking, I don't know, full tilt what you can build. And, like that'll always, I think, be one of our greatest strengths and weaknesses, is like, probably between you and I, we can build anything. So then, like, where do we start and stop will always be a challenge, but we're never going to solve that.

Opportunity or, you know, use a non-tech one. It's like, okay, well, let's stop building towns. And then it comes up out of nowhere and it's like, oh, fuck, maybe we can do construction, but at what point do we say, actually, we don't get involved in.

That's just one piece, which I just think, specifically for this QFCC thing, I think there's a couple of key questions to jump out to me. One is... Like, what does it actually look like from your perspective in working with them?

And what is driving that? And why do we want to work with them?

On paper, like...

We don't need, like this deal isn't going to pay for anything that we've got. Which comes back to another piece, but it's like... Which is the first thing she started with, but it's like, I'm pretty sure we've got financial safety and runway to be okay.

And so, dollars wise. I should have started with that because that was what I was thinking on the drive home.

How's that? The seed that supports the work, in a way. Yeah, but we can also burn through that cache, right? Or we can say we want more. Of course. There's a million things, but at the moment, it seems like we've got enough money saved between now and the end of the year.

If then it's like well if this project came off and they're like oh we want to give you half a million dollars like what is it you know what is it actually? There's a couple of things. One is like a season thing in terms of like I used to work there. I have an understanding of what they were trying to do and understand how they failed in that in a lot of ways.

Second is like, I think there's a narrative that I want to keep leaning into which is working with young people and hearing their voices and understanding how that shifts systems. This gives an opportunity to do that on a broader scale and understanding a crunchy part of that in having that youth justice lens as well.

And then...

This is probably a bad reason to do it, but.

In understanding, like, what our capacity is to work with government in terms of a database type thing, like, I was very interested in that.

I feel like this is going to draw a lot of my resource away from other things and so balancing that on other projects like... If there was a weighting, I'd be like Alice Springs, Tannock Creek, Palm Island has priority over this. But yeah, does this help those other things as well, I guess?

Do you think they actually have access to young people? What's the difference between someone like... If you're gonna back... Palm... Sean... Brody... Fucking... Uh... Like, uh, Kirin, do you think they're actually close to the young people, or do you think it's more from like a policy perspective, or?

Good question. I don't know the answer. But I think they have more...

They have more potential to be able to implement those young people's voices in a way that

Like, my focus is on almost supporting them, in a way, to get better or to be better people or to, like, work their own shit out, whereas this is almost... The ability to use young people's voices to shift particular things or give them more opportunity I guess.

Because I would say, like, if there was one end result with this thing that I would be excited by, it would be, like, if they provide opportunity to almost pay for these young kids to have a job there and to be a group in which they create their own capacity to deliver this.

That would be my... the thing I'd be most excited about. I'm not sure if that's really right.

Yeah, and you know, you know that much better than me, maybe I'm just like putting them in a very judgmental bucket, but from my understanding they're working within a government construct. You're going to have, like if you look at the scale, you've probably got the pick end or your...

You've probably got Brody End, which is like Soul, Founder, Super, or Jack Brody End at one end. And then you've got like... Probably somewhere in the middle, these pink, lucas orange sky things. And then you've got this other end, which is government, where...

Like, um, like you saw what we went through with Max just to do a 20 grand filming project, right? It's like structured contracts, you know, agreements. In that agreement, it's like all skewed around decreasing their risk and managing.

I know this is a more new and we've got buy-in from the leader, but at what point, like, are we being realistic that... My thinking at the moment is it's probably not, but then we have the decision point which is like, we can become that, or through partnering, or doing it ourselves, or...

or whatnot. I like, you know, you get a million dollars to do it and you probably partner with Portable or Joseph Mark just to deal with the bullshit so we don't have to do it but then ultimately what is yeah that end piece and like is there a different way to

to package it around like you know, these motherfuckers will pay for you know, think about that fucking dumb conference thing we went to at the office of the youth. And like that's a big, that's one of the biggest engagement and innovation points. If you think about how, like it's been half a year planning that thing and then half a year reviewing it and then start again.

I'm flying, like, flying down, like they're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars just for that, but where are we taking them to in this tool, that's why. You know, like they're probably so terrified around writing someone's story down having it on a piece of paper or whatnot that like is it something that they could just pay for.

going with the flow with what they need a lot but i think like for us to yeah probably just think about what Like, would it just be easier for them to fund Peak to do, you know, like this Storm Story thing, it's sort of like... The government just funded, like, throw out a bunch of money to try and help and then they let all these other people just be a little bit more flexible with what they're doing.

Yep.

I think it's an awesome test to see whether they just want something fixed or whether they want to go on a journey to... build something or to have a system that's developed and i think you're right like i think it's it's it's an outsourcing call for them right being like

We don't want to deal with the risk of having to tell young people's stories because we don't know how to do that. Yeah, so. Yeah I think to be able to come with questions as well as like like I don't want this the same as a pitch to them you know man it's like how do I create

This is a curious data point for them to then come back and be like, it sounds like we're not the right fit, here's six options or whatever. Or, we can provide this service, but we think that this is where you're at, whatever.

Yeah, I think it's probably two parts. And one last one is like, it's very easy to see that Natalie has no faith in her staff on this stuff. Like in terms of how she's been talking to me and she has a narrative of people in government are going to do this for their own good, not for the kid's good. So I think that's an interesting.

It's a starting framework to walk into that, you know, and to understand that as a philosophy from her perspective.

Yeah, I think it's like really, and like it's hard when some people don't know what they want, but I think like one part of it is... Seeing if we can help them understand what they want or what they're trying to solve. Like what's the thing that they're really, and like Marcus does it so much better than I do, with just like starting every meeting with like...

If you want a horror in style, what's your challenge? And then going into then thinking about where does our shit overlap. Because if they're holding it around, like, femininity and young people and... Or get in shape, filling the pipeline of stories or... What now?

So, yeah, that's probably one part, and then I do think there's an interesting part which is like, yeah, how much we outsource is. Tash from Accountable Futures is definitely coming to mind. She's obviously dealing a lot with...

So random.

A lady on Palm Island who got my number off one of the mattress topper boxes because she just found it in her yard. Yeah.

Sorry, I just muted you. Um, yeah, we'll close that one off. Like, you reckon, go for it, be curious, get feedback. Yeah, I think just start the meeting with like, you know, what do you, what are you trying to solve, or how do you think we can, can help you? And then, um,

Oh, no.

I'm going to raise my water bottle.

Very frustrating.

Yeah, just ask them what they want and then maybe, like you said, share a bit of a thing around the journey you've been on. Because if it's actually around, all we want from them is permission to test it. I think it's a much bigger ask than going into about, let's work together or whatnot, because, like, you know, what does that look like? And, you know, we might not know that, and that's just something we need to find and feel out maybe.

Or it might actually be just Rachel's super excited, but it's like, actually, in all reality, this is going to be fucking awful to work through. It's the Who piece as well, like, who am I working with, like, some of those staff there, like, they're just, they're just public.

Co? Um... Do you wanna... One thing... I was keen to talk about was the Palm Island trip, where we were together. Yep. Um, the one... One thing I was thinking about in the car was almost like, for lack of a better word, there's this almost like innovation lab that's happening there that people want to run at.

And then there's like three projects that are related to that, and I think part of it is giving them very good updates and clarity in terms of Some of those artifacts, like what's it look like? What's it feel like? Because some of those things, it's just interesting, like hearing Karen Rachel talk, it was like, I think she thinks that it's going to send it to like a photo studio or something, and people are going to see it.

So it's like... Because they're not going to drive this project management stuff, right? Yeah. But then yeah, it's like coming back to the same thing, it's like... Yeah, what are we almost getting out of it in terms of the broader story piece? But then also how do we pitch it in terms of like...

All of the muddy stuff is, you know, aligned with this off-campus community.

And then the last one is almost like, yeah, how do we position ourselves away, like, Mick and Ben coming to save the day, you know what I mean? How do we position that as well? And just to confirm, you ran over a contract break for the last thing? No, I've tried a few times.

Yeah, I think it's probably one of those things where it's like, do we just fucking send it or do we wait?

I think we're in a safe space. We're going to chuck some assumptions back at him. But yeah, I was just trying to think about what do we want to... What permission do we need to play? So I think there's like, yeah, there's that very specific point around.

It is off-pipetrail, which I think we just packaged into a time thing. Unless it's the thing that helps close out this storm story thing, which is around, like, do you think after that trip in... Our next trip, will we have enough to present back to them, like, you know, a bit of a...

a book website, too, which it feels like we do. On that one, it's probably, I say yes. And then I think the main.

I think that's, like, I'd love to be able to close that out, I think, like... The opportunities that exist in terms of that broader knowledge saving down shit is cool I reckon. I think like not that I want to close this storm shit out because of... Like, just to get it done, but I think to be able to have that contained into a piece so we can move on is good.

Yeah. And then I think there's a piece around forming up like this first phase of like the photo studio scanning. What not, um, which I think we probably just hit because like, that design, discovery, whatever it is. Which I don't think I... Yeah.

And there's another piece around what support do we want from them for the week of the show.

And then probably just starting on the front for those next scripts I think.

What, um, what's that December date that was in them? Do they have a specific date for that one? Uh, December or September and the end. No, October, sorry. Yes. Ah, no. I think they do. I don't have it though. In September?

September and October, yeah. I feel like maybe it was the 9th or something like that, but I can't remember.

Yeah, well it's, I think those are like, it's a pretty good, especially being there every month, right? So yeah, I think that's a good shout to like, I think they'll respond really well to almost like, here's the dates on there, here's what we're doing.

Here's the cost. I think that's probably a good next stage type thing.

I'm just making sure we're not promising too much from each of those discoveries or processes.

So yeah, it's a decision there. Do you want me to, do you want to give Rachel a call and do you want me to have a crack at a bit of an email back to them and then share your address?

If we can't get her, then we'll start sending shit, but yeah.

One question on palms, where's, like this is always a tough one, where do we sit with Rangers and Richard and what they're doing? I'm going to call Natalie today. I'm sure, yeah, my sort of thinking is... They're probably the safe and easiest space to get the shit sent to and whatnot, but I don't... Like, if I had to...

Provide a preference on who to make these washing machines and next version beds with, would be big.

Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't, yeah, yeah. Like in young people's allotment it can be like 25 or under, so.

I reckon, like, even being in community and just, like, asking a bunch of people, there's going to be some people around to, um...

How are you going to balance your own sky versus other things? That's one of the questions I was going to ask. So realistically, all the board are flying in on Friday morning. And Thursday, Lucas and Jude playing. So I'm pretty, like, my thing is, like, Monday through Thursday go pretty hard on AXA.

There is a couple of little classic things where Jimmy is going to fly to town early in the week. And also the way it's been attained. I'm just trying to pick up on this a little bit more. I don't know if there's anything else. But... Yes, there'll be a couple of little things there, but it begins to be on the orange sky train. And do you have a preference when I bounce or not bounce?

I reckon, so I'm on the barge Saturday morning. Not the barge, the ferry. And then I'll be at 8. I'll fly back to Bristol that night, and then I'll take a break, so, um, I reckon... I'll be PMIA Thursday afternoon, Friday, but I also think you could use Friday for more story stuff.

If you don't need to be back for any family stuff, I also think... Knowing Lucas, he'll get excited that you're taking some photos of the board, right? Of course. You know, Rich is going to do a cultural tour of the lot. At a worse case, you could just roll on that for more story stuff, but don't hang around just for lack of a fine.

Fuck, this is one of those things where it's like a FOMO thing, right? But it doesn't matter. Like, I was really pumped to go to Alice Springs, but...

It was so interesting, did I send you those links or have you found all the grants up online? No.

Like the homestead, because I typed in, I was trying to find where the homestead was. And so I just put that into Google and the NIAA grant, like there's a portal. And so, yeah, it's like 117,000. They got it in 2021, and they've delayed it. And they're putting an extension every year, but this is like the final.

Final, final extensions if they don't spend the money to expires on like the end of this year, calendar year.

So, I sort of just, yeah, that's why I presented back that thing around, it's like, well, we probably want to do it before it gets too hot, you know, cut it up in a couple of little...

And what's your feeling about that? Does that turn into something bigger? Is it self-contained? Your thoughts.

I think it needs to be contained in a sense of like...

Yeah, like, you'd burn through that pretty quickly.

Yeah, it's, it's, I don't know, like, it's in this, in this weird dreamy, dreamy state and not in the doing state, but like... It's the same as this pic stuff, right, where it's like you land the storm stories and it's like is that just like we're working together.

forever thing and then it's like how do you start to what's the balance between why these full-time jobs are a fucking joke because you rock up every day and you get paid and yeah Not that every dollar should be covered or whatnot, which is all over the shop, but coming back to the first thing you showed me.

The things I wrote down is probably the... I appreciate the audience is internal for us. But I think we probably just need to rationalise what's this revenue potential, and putting numbers next to things, because obviously... There's an income, but then there's also an expense, and there's like a profit margin and all that sort of stuff, and, um...

Yeah, I was just thinking about that, where it's like it's all, I don't know, it's great to see, I don't know.

$80,000 as a cabin sold to reach, but in reality probably made $3,000. It looks like a lot of money coming in, but it's actually... Fuck all, and for the emotional, you know, um, and just thinking about one of the things is like, do we detach? Like obviously it's clear deliverables financially.

And what not, but do we actually detach Project and money through to then just money coming in? Umm

As like a well, and obviously that money needs to be, we need to understand where it's coming from, but yeah, so just thinking about that, um, I was almost thinking about like for us, like, what's the death certificate for? I mean it's like at one point you're like this is shit um uh and the same it's like you know this idea of uh

Hobby's a crook word, but it's like, you know, at what point is Carla like, oh I think you need to go get a real job.

You know, like, so what is that? Water bottle, yes.

Um, yeah, and so I think, like, we're making all this stuff up and there's no right or wrong, but it's like, do we choose... Like a base salary.

I keep it going back to slow, but it's like, I sent it in three days a week each, for six months from now until the end of the year. And it's like, maybe, one, it's like I need to actually put that in my calendar and think about, will I...

Is that realistic? Is that what not? But then you start to add in, you know, say we choose a base salary and that time, then it's like, well actually when you add in... It's like, well, actually, our wages are sorted between now and January. And then we want to actually get, you know, 12 months of wages sorted, plus then six months of rolling cash flow in case we didn't get any work sorted.

Then there's a key focus which is around, well actually this can fund x, y and z of our things. As well, us sort of having a bit of a fun to, um, you know, like the...

20 grand to build this contained thing I'm not too worried about because most of that, like Piper being just fucking an awesome project, most of the sunk cost can be Recouped in a sense of like, yes, you know, buying a side opening container is heaps more expensive than a traditional container, but it's also like we can, we can put that on the property and.

We could put it on the farm, we could put it on the instrument thing, so it's like, it's just a cost at a point in time, but then it's just like, how do we... It's the same as buying the printer. It's like, you know, two grand's not going to sink us. It'll keep us moving forward and have something, but then like we probably can't make.

20 of those bits. In that space, yeah, I was sort of just thinking about like inputs, outputs, time.

Yeah, there's two main bits. One is that notion that things are a bit like an experiment. To see how automated you can make that shit.

The second one is... I think I was doing lots of thinking about what is security, and... It's probably way too much, but I was just looking at every single thing, every single input that I had that was like, how do I know what security is? And there's a bunch, right? There's Carla's job, there's our sofa, there's savings, there's kids, whatever. And...

I think one input is the runway, as you were talking about with ACT, and it's like, what does that give us in terms of a runway? Six months, a year, whatever. And then there's a secondary runway. Which is much more of a philosophical thing for me, is like, how do I not turn into my father with finances and money? And how do I look at, like...

like ties into my philosophy of life or whatever and so it was almost like I was doing a bit of like a value thing of like Family, travel, fun type shit. And that almost like sits somewhere, right? Be like, here's all the shit. Maybe you check in on that every year or whatever. And then this process is exciting to be able to see

Here's the types of work. And then every time a new thing comes in, like Max, for example, from Disability or whatever, it's like, where does this align to? Maybe it's just fun coffee every month where we talk about it and that's enough to go on shifts with him and having a contract.

Yeah, that's the two main things. And like, I love what you were saying there and like this whole desk scuba thing of like, because as I was doing that stuff and looking at the cash and looking at like this thing that says a million dollars, whatever, I was just like, this is not fun.

But at the same time, what was fun was thinking about that fella that we met with, that business expert fella. And then like, working out like, of all the shit that he does as expertise, how much could you just automate that we don't have to fuck around with him? Yeah.

And yeah, that was part of that whole building process. Yeah, they're interesting answers.

Is that realestate.com?

Yeah, like there's no infrastructure or anything on it. Oh, I saw this. I showed Carla. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, it's probably just thinking about...

There's colour design in the house, and like you get land, colour design's the house, in five years time you save up and you build that house, and then in ten years time you move into it, you know what I mean? That's yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about with that like longer planning stuff is what's the Because the journey with that stuff is what's the exciting part of it, right? It's like just having a project

And then it's just having that same philosophy of being like, is buying this thing fun? And is it connected to what we want? Because that whole process of that housing is turned into every weekend we sit around and the girls look at places and we look at places and it's like, you know what I mean? It's an activity. And so it's, yeah, I think it's a...

Yeah, it's one of those things that postpones the death certificate, maybe.

Yeah, but I think it's just coming in touch with that. Yeah. Which, like I said, is really fun.

Like, I don't know what mid to high 1 million means. But, you know, you get a pass away for a million bucks. It's the same size, no, a bit bigger than... Buckets next door. And then you've got another one million or one and a half million to build a pretty rad house on, right?

Or not, you know. And it'd actually be a thing where it can sit for a couple of years and we do a bunch of little projects on it. But it actually, like, we try and get... Yeah, programs on it. Like cost neutral. But, yeah, yeah. As in like, then it's going to make that investment.

Um, yeah, and then just back on like, if you have little notes to write down when you're sharing that thing, like, I do... And these things are all continuums, but I think there's an interesting continuum between like automation... and scale versus like nuance and beauty in the art and um

I just thought about all these people that have just got websites because they're told they need a website, or get an annual report that say they need an annual report that actually mean nothing. And I was just thinking about like our pages and whatnot is, I think it's easy to wake up and we have like 20 pages for our 20 projects.

But if it's not actually serving us, how do we lean into that, which I think comes back to the art of practice. We've become really keen to do some planning around this week, around like, you know, even this chat's an awesome one, but it's like, how do we...

For the inbox training session where we just go through the notion of inbox and synchronous or how do we actually have a... You know, a deeper, more philosophical chat by trying to build those different practices in. And then another one I just wrote down when I was talking to Leonie about the buttery is this whole idea of a CRM is really interesting.

The two words that really jump out at me is relational and management, and so I think management for me means process and automation. tooling and that sort of thing, whereas relationship and relational is like, it's almost like the art and the science, like the art is the relational and the science is the um...

Easy.

Is the process and the management is just thinking a little bit about like, um, with this empathy ledger stuff, but also with like more curious tractor running stuff, like, what is that? That goods advisory board and where does that show up for other projects and I thought so much at that Red Ark conference about this idea like they

We brought all our partners together for a conference, and one of the topics at the conference was talking about average cost of talent. And so they were saying, like, you know, an apprentice cost me $28 an hour in Western Australia. And someone was like, well, actually, it cost me $34 in Queensland. And they were talking about, like, they had a couple of bits of data, but they were just talking about, like...

how to manage overheads, and so I just thought about like, you know, that stuff we've been talking about around the Christmas parties and whatnot. It's like, do we know that We can get a group of healthcare workers together and for them to just have a good time at the farm is like doing this fucking rip of the bullet on like what Audible does around the

Yeah, build on that, which it is.

100% and I get that it comes back to this um Like I almost want to do a deep dive into the case study of My relationship with Brodie Germain, do you know what I mean? I'm being like, we've got to this point now, what the fuck do we do? Like, he's got everything he needs, right? And so it's like, what's...

What's our role in this next phase of his existence? What's that relationship? And like for me As you're saying like Should be able to bring a bunch of people to Mount Isa that wants to do what Brody did, right? And like, create a moment to share and reflect and...

Like, I'm so keen for that same shit to happen to Sean, right? And how does that relationship continue to foster and grow? How do we share that as a group, create those relationships? And I think it is about creating moments, right, where you're like coming together and you're talking.

as one your because this stuff with um kate and this fella g like this fella g has all the kids you want you know i need you know i mean to tell that amazing story about youth justice and like He, the relationship I built with him was around me meeting him a few times, me sharing my story. He's now very comfortable and open to share.

His relationship with his young people and then it's like the next stage would be bringing everyone together to then understand how the young people start to shape their story as part of that community. It's like a, yeah, moving from that like, how do you, um, like everyone's always like trying to find the Aboriginal kid's story, right, to be like...

But how do you do that relationally and the right way?

Should we rip through a couple of these things now? Monday, Sunday, Tuesday at the top. Website? Yeah, so I just like... I don't know, I feel like we're just at a point where I'm just trying to get this done. Like, drive it and just almost be her free labour.

Yeah, so I just think it's just like... I don't know, I'll just...

I didn't have a massive look through what she wanted there, but I don't think it's too complicated. And I'll order the signs. And then I think you follow it up with both those about time and walk and talk people, but I might just let you run on those. Yep.

And then yeah, I've got this TFN pitch tomorrow, which I think is about like six minutes or something. And so I just wanted to bounce some thoughts with you. On it is, I was going to, sorry do you mind if I take this call? Yeah man, go for it. I'm going to talk.

I've got 100% now. Oh no, one more to go, one more to go. Where did we get to there? To TFN pitch. Yeah, so I was just thinking about this idea around, I think it's a bit cliche, but I think it works, around getting them, like almost what we said at our own show, like all your majors, possible to a major that's not your homework.

I think, like, sort of talking about this idea, like, I want you to think about the bed that you woke in, woke up, like, went to bed last night and woke up in, like, imagine that mattress. It was taken outside and it was rained on. Almost like you just go through a very literal, to get people to the point of why these new products are needed and then starts to talk about the plastic waste and that sort of thing. So there's no slides.

It is meant to be pretty conversational.

Yeah, I think we're in for a pretty... I reckon we're a pretty good fit for it. It's probably just... I'd say we're a little bit grainer than what they... They expect us, most of the other groups in that are probably in a similar spot to you, I just wanted to get your thoughts around if there's anything that came to mind here.

From what I've seen and what the processes look like, it seems like super good fit.

what's what's it actually look like though I guess like it's just online and it's just sitting down and it's quite casual yes Yeah, like we're... Yeah, 20 minutes. So speak only for 3-4 minutes and then time for questions. What do you think will connect with them? Or is it more general? I don't know, maybe like a bit of RHD stuff. And then I think like, because this is a lot around like caring for the environment is around like the, like I think focusing on the waste element.

I think would be the key part of it.

Any questions, you reckon? Yeah, yeah. So, like they, I don't know where, oh I'm doing it solo for some reason. But I think it's because they only want one person fishing, they're pretty dingy, but I don't know, I think I'm probably just a little bit triggered by the Maya stuff, in a sense of like, going in maybe a bit combative and passive.

I'm passionate about it, but I think probably going in with a little bit more curiosity and painting the picture a little bit more is the feedback we've heard. And how does the choosing of it happen? Is it just one and then that's it? No, it's three.

Any specific one for me, or you're just feeling good? No, no, I'm just trying to run past your dang jump daddy, but... No. Oh. Um, sweet. Mental health. Yeah. Very. Obscure research, mental health, yeah, yeah, yeah, so it's just a nice process to go through. It was interesting to see how that research stuff happens.

Like they've submitted something, it might not happen, but our role would be like engaging the stuff that we're doing in community in terms of like, whether it's art, workshops, engagement. When I had a quick look, I just saved it down, so I thought there was some really cool language and diagrams and context and all that sort of shit in that.

Good to see you, Chas.

Um, the thing that jumped out at me was the, um, uh, like, it said we're doing it in kind. Like, cause I was like, I flicked around, I was like, what are we actually fucking doing here?

But it is, like, I don't care, like, I'm sure you could be a part of it, but it's just... It says 25 grand sitting there for us. Ah, cool. Right, cool. Um, just a quick like open yarn about eyes, we've already talked about Brody and stuff, but um Where did we have him when we closed the loop on his allegations and like what you did with a bit of a reset with him on that week and all that sort of stuff?

Much in my mind closed, like maybe there will still be some overarching things, but they've closed the current investigation. They traced it back to one bloke putting in an allegation about him and then the police came up with an opinion on that. There's a- he's got a lot of support from Elders there around, like, what happened and, like, pretty good support base around that stuff. The whole place stuff's just fucking weird.

I was most interested in, now that he has this support, like, what's... I'm mostly interested in Mount Isa as a location and how this is a huge opportunity for young people in the region now. How do I move myself into this next phase, where it's like, what is the role there, how much resource, like, how much time, I guess?

And then broader like Mount Isa as a Justice Hub location look like and how does that support that case study to be built out and yeah, like that bit's exciting. If we can have a little bit of music, cool, storytelling, impact centerpiece, most crime in Queensland, fucking turning that around, yep.

How do I maintain that story whilst also support Brody? That's my overarching thoughts. See, I think there's also like, um, I know you, you pushed it, um... But like, the only reason we've got a connection to Tennant Creek is we went up there and put goods in there, but there's nothing stopping us from putting goods into our ISA.

Which I think even isn't like that whole idea around like if we were about to do this palm project in Mount Isa it'd be fucking a billion times easier finding kids in Mount Isa to make beds with. Um... Yeah, like even an allocation so there's no time. You know, like you can do it... You can work from wherever. Yeah.

I don't know, I'd be open to everything in that space around, like, do we say to Brody, like as a part of this in-kind, contra-transfer thing, like, do we... Rent an office or a goods depot out of his... Yeah, it's pretty big, it's close. Or, you know, do we... and do we start getting...

If you've had sent to him and do we do a sprint on on that or same with the empathy ledger stuff like That's where, again, not to be negative on it, but the QFCC stuff is interesting, which is like, actually, if you want to set up a... pilot empathy ledger community and you want to go to Mount Isa and you want them to fund the pilot and then at the end of the pilot

That actually funds the due diligence and the pre-casing of it. And so, you know, you fucking... You're a... Yaksha, that's what it is. They fuck around for ages, but it's like, oh, actually, we want to do this project in... Let it rip sort of thing.

Yeah, it's good. There might be some, like, um, yeah, overarching stuff with Max as well with this. Like, he's really interested in that region.

The next one was Mark's, and that's literally just like... The more I talk to him about this... Mapping, same stuff as it, like, it's kind of like, um, how do you compound some of this shit, like the Barclay stuff? Yeah. If that does come through, or if we want to do that, like, it's a very similar...

Can that be an empty ledger module type experience thing that we can build, I guess, is my question.

Because I need to go back to Barclay in the next week or so, I reckon. Have they shared anything? Deb just wants me to come back. She said, you know, everything. Please come back with, like, what you think it is and what you can offer, type thing. Yeah.

It's like service, story, that sort of shit.

Yeah, I think I'm happy to like, if you want to draft something, I'm happy to like chuck in a few points and thoughts. Is there any overarching thing from Snow for text? One of us will probably be back in Tennant. Like, if we played forward, if we didn't go to Sand Creek once next year, I think it would be a pretty awkward conversation with Sally and Georgie. Even if they didn't fund it, right?

And so, yeah, like if we look at maybe we've been to the tenant four times this year, maybe have another two, like at six, that's at every two months. Like, do we actually then say, well, cool, we're gonna be in tenant, you know? That many times next year, so what can we actually do together? What's the online stuff? We're like, naturally, with this Willie Johnson shit, like, we're gonna be fuckin'...

Is there an opportunity to double down on some efficiencies in that space?

Yeah, so that would be some of the thinking, and then as well as like it says on that stuff that we really want to do, that they can get us access to.

Yeah.

So, what, like, Brazos or Funding or Paypal or...? Oh, yeah, all of them.

I'm sorry, I'm just going to have to wait a little.

One, two, three, four. You're on.

Here's a good one. You ready? Yes. Carla was like, why are you buying those pens? They're gonna go mouldy. This is a good, like, Carla's chat. What do you think about that? I would say it's a key risk. The other thing I think about is... With the right process, they don't. And it really stuck with me around this idea of if we start thinking long term,

If we can get these things to stay the last for three years, would we find more... I guess this is sort of like philosophy, like if we believe in place-based activations of events, like we might not need 30 of these tents. But would we find a use for six of them?

And so I think the answer in that is yes. And then it's around a lot of the risks and whatnot, but like. Is it something that Polly could run the business for us? Do you know what I mean? It's like, or do we actually get, you know... As in, like, kids from the justice system. And, like, do we start to test these things?

Yeah, like around our process for it, where it's like actually how do we take that shit seriously around sweeping stuff out and making sure it's dry and whatnot, but like, um...

The thing that I really felt when I went to the farm yesterday is like, um...

How do I keep on growing the agency for Susie and Alicia? They're at a really interesting inflection point, where they've gone from this unsure, primal, settling... You know, going up there. So then it's like, well, what are the opportunities where like, Susie's like, oh, we want to get chickens and like all this sort of stuff, where it's like actually this stuff is possible now where...

You've got people that care about the space. It's the same as like, is there a reality in the square? It's the same with the Q-Coffer, the child family stuff. Like, does Polly actually want to be setting up tents every second weekend? She might be like, absolutely not. I couldn't think of anything worse. Whereas she's like, oh actually, that's something that's quite fun.

We put our beds in a...

Yeah, and then we package it up as kids, and then maybe like we do, like even if we just paid back that roadie stuff, if it's like, if we did an event at the farm, and invited a bunch of people to it, and then packaged all that stuff up. and then sent it to a community like Straddy or Palm Island or Mount Isa and did the same

If we think about the Small Giants retreat, if we did one at a similar style at the farm and then one on country every year, and you just did two. you know, Justice CoLab meetups, that kit would pay for itself, but it's just the admin and us having to deal with the emotional thing around like if a tent blew over and...

Someone got him injured or the tent was moldy or Like do we want to be doing that? But I think that's probably the thing that I'm curious about

It's not impossible if it's done right, I think is my philosophy. But it's like that level of detail around having a tent drive down and vacuuming it out.

And even little things like, again, not to bring Carla and the girls into this unless they want to be, but it's like, if a curious tractor bought six hens... And then Carla and the girls wanted to have their friends to the farm and set them up. Like it doesn't cost us anything. Whereas now, it would cost us $5.40 a head to do that.

You know, or the same as like, could we set those tents up at the shed in your backyard? Like, I'm pretty sure we'll find a use for them. The issue will come when it's like... We go to open the tents up to run the van and we lend them to Brody and they come back and they've got buggin' mould all through it and it's like just because we didn't run that process right.

What are they packed down to in terms of transport? Oh, like a...

I don't know, like a suitcase, briefcase size. They're pretty small. The poles are like 680mm. How many would fit in our car? Like our boot?

You'd fit all six in there for sure. It'll be just what we decided. So they use air mattresses. It's all that sort of, you know. Pillows and blankets and fucking jammies and shit that would start to, um...

Cool. So, decision point is do it and then correct? Um, they, so I booked Snooch's flight last night. Cool. Um, I'm keen to go out into our lab and start getting people to organise it. And then, my thinking was...

But I think it's just nice to have that sorted, like around, you know, that worked well last time, and like, are we super worried about costs and that sort of thing? But then also, like... Yeah, and like they were super open to like discharging us a flat fee to set our tents up if we buy them and pack them down and all that sort of stuff, so.

I'm really confident, as well, that Susie would be able to stand up with a palm in the future and pack him down properly and that sort of thing.

And maybe it's a little scoping thing of like...

Yeah, does the asset force us or help us to create more events because we have the asset almost? And what's that process look like, I guess?

Yeah, it's cool.

Um, super quick one. I'm catching Kieran for 2 hours on Friday. Um, next steps is, like, he's excited about building out the strategic roadmap type experience. It feels like he likes us as strategy, communication, consultant, supporters. It all leans in quite heavily to this Justice Hub stuff, engagement stories, everything. Like, I'm still happy to keep.

Rolling and building the partnership and understanding what that is all about. I just wanted to check your... Check your... I just wanted to check your... I just wanted to say it as well. I think it's a good opportunity for you to be aware of what's different out there.

Yeah, I think it's just like two things. One, it's like Kieran will be on Palm that week, so it's another good opportunity to hang with him. Keep telling, creating that our story with him. And the other thing is like, is there any lessons from what you've learned from Sean or...

or Brody that we can take into Kieran. Is it around keeping it If we were Joseph Mark, I would be keeping an inventory of equity we've invested to then try and get buyback, which is obviously very transactional. Is it around clarity of certain things, like is it expectations, like what's that?

And it can change, but I think even it's like...

Why are we working together in this current stage is that you see immense cultural wisdom and you want to learn from Kieran or is it is it? Is it a voluntary, is it always going to be part of what we do? He's doing shit for free. And we just need to cop that and we need to pull that out.

You know, Kat's calling me asking me to build her an office, and like, you know, and design posters and stuff, and just being like, you know what? It's just easier for us to do it than actually... You know, but also with I, we have put ourselves into that.

Part of it is, like I can actually, like it took me a little while, but I can actually see what he's trying to do now, and like it's kind of exciting. I think the third one is, I think there is a pretty good fit if there was a chance to be like a partner alongside this and then work out.

Whether that is a financial or a connection point across justice, that's a core opportunity, case study, whatever, as part of what those two things are. But yeah, I think, like, I think after this next conversation, strategically, is just understanding, getting on the same page with that, is like calling that out pretty clearly and just being like, well is this, is this turning into something, should we just create?

Because I think when it does turn shit, it's like, if I'm turning around photos and videos and I'm just being like, it's fine. Like, that's when I'm tough. I want to be able to be clear about that. But yeah, if there's like a place for us to support that vision, I think it's cool because it is like a pretty broad big thing.

I, um... Did I send it to you? I don't know, it was my client texting me that you weren't working last night. Um... I got served this ad about an AI photo editor. I'm sure you've come across it. Where is it?

Thank you for your time and reading through the comments.

It'll be like, oh, I'm so supportive of this, so then it can get rid of all the muffets from our industry, and then my art can actually be. Like, yeah, so yes, I think like, obviously people are like pro, like how do you actually, like that's the whole art form is the editing process and whatnot.

It seems like you get all the right protocols around how you want stuff edited and what not and it goes through and it looks like if you've got multiple photos, what's the one that people are looking the most and that sort of thing. It's hilarious. It's cool.

Yeah, that's kind of that one. I'm pretty comfy with that for now anyway.

That's kind of it. Like, the Justice Hub stuff's still burning. Like, I think I've got a... It's nice to have that October sort of area date to think about that being a launch. I'm excited about where I've got to with this framework of what it is. I think profiling people is a really cool part of it.

And I think it's a watch and see thing with Snow Foundation stuff, right? Just to see what happens there. But I just want to be able to keep funneling all the stuff through it, right? Just to, like, that's the way in which I know that some of these opportunities are, like, in line with philosophy and thinking is if I can funnel everything through there.

And part of my vision, of why I want to keep doing this, is like, over the next few years... If there are stages in where we have more runway than other times, like, how could I just do that for six months and read stories and travel around and that sort of stuff?

It's something I'd love to be able to do, like, have a place where that happens. It's cool. Different places around the world, or Australia. Um, this closes tonight as well. I have it on my iMac.

Ah, true.

Oh yeah. This is a study-based one, yeah?

I remember this from last year.

You're just interested in what it would be like in terms of process? I'd say it's an awesome community, right? I don't know how many Western people are in it.

Maybe we can hold each other accountable to the team, I don't know. When's it due tonight? Tonight, yeah. Yeah, let's just do it.

I think that's the main thing. I'm going to get a bit of work done on the file versus some things that might come up, but maybe if we just go through this week actually. Oh sorry, so the buttery... Did you get an email from anyone there? No. Okay, I'll do a follow-up. They're keen for you to come down if it works for you next Tuesday.

Yep. Do you want me to reach out? No, I'll follow up. Yeah, they were just, they're like clinical directors, you know, line up a bunch of residents. their staff and what not. And essentially it was around, similar to what we did with Barclay, around building a localised language model where you get a heaping series around what is being and then push it through like an empty media play. She reckons she spends a day a week writing.

Grant applications or writing pitches. And I was like, I'm pretty sure you could automate some of that stuff. Yeah. No, I'll be keen. Be nice. It's just there's the that smart thing that day in the morning.

I'm just saying 11 to 12 place on Talk about oh, you know It's just talking about Okay. Yeah. And actually on that one, that 20th date, I'm going to be out at the. It sounds like she wanted us to include May, but I was planning to work on May before that.

I'll try and join you, but is there a reception out there, or is it pre-scheduled? They've got Wi-Fi at the station, but... OK. Yeah, I think I'll try and be fully present too. Yeah, oh for sure. Yeah, we'll make a bit of a... That's the end of the memo. I think I'll have lunch with Jess and then go pretty mental and solve our homes. I am talking with the shed.

At 6 o'clock review time. That's in Alder and Michelle.

You know the pivot I shared, the community shared at 10k? But I'm happy to do that one solo.

Have you been thinking more about Tennant Creek properties? It hasn't left my mind, yeah.

Yeah, I might have a play with that, like, resource runway type thing. It'd be fun to see if there's a clear way to see that finance runway and then dreaming of... Oh, I do. Yep.

Love to. Any of our intended is to have a peep at that property and get a bit of info around like, you know, Alba and Michelle, like the town's pretty small, right? So someone will know the context behind it. It might be some doomed, technically racist site that's contaminated, but most people don't see that in an ad.

It might be like, oh, it's crack inside, but now I want to deal with renovating it. And that's like, oh, that's pretty good now for your drive. Yeah, I was thinking about it when I was in Denman because Nan was telling me about this story about a young girl that went missing and then within half hour, every person in town was in their backyard looking for this kid.

And I was thinking about how community comes together to, like, how nice it would be to feel that we were part of Tenant Creek and we were part of that community.

Thank you, brother. Super thankful, friend. Yeah. Appreciate the session. Yeah. I'm going to do a bit of jet board planning with Green. Let's bounce some Atlantic stuff. Just remember I made an account like a month ago. I think it's going to take a little while to make an account, so I reckon make one now and see if it, because I feel like it's something that they have to tick off or something. Alright, I'll do it now.
