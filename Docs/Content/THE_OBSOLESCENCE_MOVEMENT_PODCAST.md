## Stories of Building Movements That Don't Need You

## 🌟 Podcast Vision

**"The greatest organizations build movements that don't need them."**

The Obsolescence Movement is a weekly podcast celebrating communities that took flight after their rocket boost. Each episode features authentic voices of community members who found their own power, created their own solutions, and now teach others without any ongoing support from the organizations that initially helped them.

### Core Philosophy
- **Community voices first** - No host commentary or expert analysis
- **Authentic, unpolished stories** - Raw community conversations
- **Success through independence** - Celebrate communities that no longer need help

- **Beautiful obsolescence** - Honor organizations that worked themselves out of jobs

### Key Interview Questions
1. "Tell us about the moment you realized you didn't need us anymore."
2. "What did you create that we never imagined?"
3. "How are you teaching others now?"
4. "What would you tell other communities just getting started?"
5. "What are you most proud of that has nothing to do with us?"
