## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application
- **Backend**: Express.js API server
- **Database**: Supabase/PostgreSQL with Notion integration
- **Storage**: Media management with Supabase storage
- **Deployment**: Separated frontend/backend deployment strategy

### Key Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clean frontend/backend separation
2. **Scalability** - Multi-tenant architecture preparation
3. **Integration** - Notion API and Empathy Ledger foundation
4. **Performance** - Caching and optimization strategies

## 🔍 Reading Guide

### For Developers
1. Start with **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** for overall layout
2. Review **DATA_SERVING_STRATEGY.md** for API design
3. Check platform architecture docs for advanced concepts

### For System Architects
1. **OPTIMAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Current production architecture
2. **REVOLUTIONARY_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Future architecture vision
3. **EMPATHY_LEDGER_PLATFORM_STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Storage strategy
