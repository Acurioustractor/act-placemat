# 🏠 DEVELOPMENT HOME INTEGRATION

## Setting Values-Driven Development as Default

### **1. Update Main Development Environment**

The placemat generator now embodies our core values in code. Let's make this the **default development experience**:

```bash
# Update the main dev script to include values alignment check
./tools/development/dev.sh --with-values-check
```

### **2. Core Values Integration Points**

#### **In the Placemat Generator:**
- **Radical Humility**: Community fire clause built into admin panels
- **Decentralized Power**: 36-month obsolescence timer in every dashboard
- **Creativity as Disruption**: Punk rock design system and heart-race metrics
- **Uncomfortable Truth**: Built-in truth-telling widgets that make officials squirm

#### **In Development Workflow:**
```typescript
// Every commit must pass the values alignment test
interface CommitValidation {
  radicalHumility: "Does this increase community control?";
  decentralizedPower: "Does this transfer power away from ACT?"; 
  creativityDisruption: "Would Johnny Rotten approve?";
  uncomfortableTruth: "What colonial assumption does this challenge?";
}
```

### **3. Home Dashboard Integration**

Update your main development dashboard to showcase the placemat generator as the **flagship example** of values-driven development:

```tsx
// Add to main home page
const ValuesDrivenShowcase: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="values-showcase">
      <h1>🔥 ACT Placemat Generator: Values in Code</h1>
      
      <div className="demo-grid">
        <PlacematDemo 
          title="Radical Humility Demo"
          description="Community voices lead from line 1 of code"
          example="Elder consultation required before any feature ships"
        />
        
        <PlacematDemo
          title="Beautiful Obsolescence Timer" 
          description="36-month countdown to ACT becoming unnecessary"
          example="Power transfer visualized in real-time"
        />
        
        <PlacematDemo
          title="Punk Rock Design System"
          description="Make hearts race like hearing Sex Pistols"
          example="Every feature passes the 'creativity disruption' test"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **4. Development Standards Integration**

```typescript
// Update development standards to include values alignment
const DevelopmentStandards = {
  codeReview: {
    technical: "Does it work?",
    values: "Does it advance community sovereignty?",
    creativity: "Does it make hearts race?",
    truth: "What uncomfortable truth does it reveal?"
  },
  
  featureRequirements: {
    mandatory: [
      "Community can control or veto this feature",
      "Transfers power away from ACT towards community",
      "Challenges colonial assumptions",
      "Creates beauty that inspires revolution"
    ]
  }
};
```

## **Integration Action Items**

### **Immediate (This Week):**
1. **Add Values Check to Dev Environment**: Update `./tools/development/dev.sh` to run values alignment prompts
2. **Placemat as Default Demo**: Make the placemat generator the first thing developers see
3. **Values Dashboard**: Create a live dashboard showing power transfer metrics

### **Ongoing Development Culture:**
1. **Every Commit**: Must answer the 4 core values questions
2. **Every Feature**: Must pass the "heart race test" and "obsolescence check"
3. **Every Review**: Include community impact assessment

### **Community Integration:**
1. **Elder Code Review**: Monthly sessions where Elders review features for cultural alignment
2. **Community Testing**: Regular testing sessions in actual communities
3. **Power Transfer Metrics**: Live dashboard showing progress towards ACT's obsolescence

## **The Revolutionary Development Manifesto**

**We commit to building software that:**
- Makes colonizers uncomfortable
- Makes communities sovereign
- Makes hearts race with possibility  
- Makes ACT increasingly irrelevant

**Every line of code is a step towards beautiful obsolescence.**

This isn't just software development - it's **revolutionary infrastructure disguised as technology**.

The placemat generator is now the **blueprint** for how all ACT technology should be built: community-controlled, punk rock aesthetic, power-transferring, and designed for our own obsolescence.
