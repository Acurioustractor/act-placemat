### **🚨 Core Problem Identified**
**Issue:** Development process is chaotic, no clear task management
**Impact:** Wasted time, unclear priorities, frustrated developer
**Solution:** Implement structured roadmap with proper AI-human workflow

---

## **Phase 1: Development Process Foundation (Week 1-2)**
*Priority: CRITICAL - Must fix before building new features*

### Task Breakdown (RICE Prioritized)

#### 1. Fix .taskmaster Integration
**RICE Score: 400 (Reach:100, Impact:4, Confidence:100%, Effort:1)**
- [ ] Debug why .taskmaster isn't working
- [ ] Implement proper task cards system  
- [ ] Create task templates for common development patterns
- [ ] Test full workflow end-to-end

#### 2. Establish Session Context Management
**RICE Score: 320 (Reach:80, Impact:4, Confidence:100%, Effort:1)**
- [ ] Create session handoff protocol
- [ ] Implement ROADMAP.md as single source of truth
- [ ] Set up context preservation between sessions
- [ ] Create session summary templates

#### 3. Define Development Priorities
**RICE Score: 240 (Reach:60, Impact:4, Confidence:100%, Effort:1)**
- [ ] Audit existing platform capabilities
- [ ] Identify top 3 user-facing improvements needed
- [ ] Create technical debt backlog
- [ ] Prioritize using RICE framework

---

## **Phase 2: High-Impact Features (Week 3-6)**
*To be defined after Phase 1 complete*

### Candidate Features (Unprioritized)
- Enhanced community dashboard
- Mobile app completion  
- Advanced AI intelligence features
- Performance optimizations
- New integrations

---

## **Progress Tracking Conventions**

### Status Indicators
- [ ] **Todo** - Not started
- [-] **In Progress** - Being worked on (with timestamp)
- [x] **Completed** - Done (with completion timestamp)
- [!] **Blocked** - Cannot proceed (with blocker description)
- [~] **Deferred** - Moved to later phase

### Session Management
- **Current session focus:** One primary task only
- **Session length:** Max 20 minutes before context review
- **Handoff protocol:** Update this roadmap at session end
- **Context preservation:** Key decisions recorded here

### Priority Framework (RICE)
- **Reach:** How many users/processes affected (1-100)
- **Impact:** Business goal achievement (1-5)  
- **Confidence:** Execution confidence (100%, 80%, 50%)
- **Effort:** Implementation complexity (1-10)
- **Score:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

---

## **Decision Log**

### 2025-01-19 16:30
- **Decision:** Stop random development, implement proper task management
- **Rationale:** Current process wastes time and creates frustration
- **Next Action:** Fix .taskmaster system before building new features

---

## **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
🚫 **Don't do random shit without clear roadmap position**
🚫 **Don't start new features without completing current tasks**  
🚫 **Don't lose context between sessions**
🚫 **Don't work without clear success criteria**
🚫 **Don't ignore this roadmap and go off on tangents**

*This roadmap is the single source of truth. Update it continuously. Both human and AI must reference it before making decisions.*
