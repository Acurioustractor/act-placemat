# 🌍 Open Source Roadmap - Community Intelligence Platform
## Building Toward Community Ownership & Self-Sufficiency

---

## 🌱 Our Vision

This platform was never meant to be owned by ACT alone. It's a community resource that should eventually belong to everyone. Our goal is to:

1. **Transfer all knowledge** to the community
2. **Build local capacity** in every region
3. **Create sustainable models** that don't depend on us
4. **Open source everything** when the community is ready
5. **Celebrate our obsolescence** as communities thrive independently

## 💻 Technical Transition Plan

### Current Architecture
```
ACT Platform (Centralized)
├── Intelligence Engine (Node.js)
├── Data Connectors (5 sources)
├── Web Dashboard
└── Community Tools
```

### Future Architecture
```
Community Nodes (Distributed)
├── Local Intelligence (Self-hosted)
├── Shared Data Pool (Federated)
├── Regional Dashboards
└── Peer-to-peer Learning
```

### Migration Path

#### Step 1: Containerization
```bash
# Docker setup for easy deployment
docker-compose up -d
# Any community org can run their own instance
```

#### Step 2: Data Federation
- Shared story repository
- Network connection pool
- Grant opportunity database
- Success pattern library

#### Step 3: Regional Instances
- Queensland node
- NSW node
- Victoria node
- Each maintaining local data

#### Step 4: Mesh Network
- Peer-to-peer connections
- No central authority
- Community governed
