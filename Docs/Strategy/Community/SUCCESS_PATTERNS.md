## 🌟 Key Success Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Story-First Grant Applications
**What We're Seeing:**

- Won 2 out of 3 (67% success vs 15% baseline)
- Key: Matched specific stories to each grant's values

**How to Replicate:**
1. Collect stories continuously, not just for grants
2. Tag stories with themes, outcomes, demographics
3. Match story emotions to funder priorities
4. Always include measurable impact
