## 🌍 Governance Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Community Owned** - This belongs to everyone, not ACT
2. **Distributed Power** - No single point of control
3. **Inclusive Voices** - Everyone has a say
4. **Transparent Decisions** - All processes visible
5. **Evolutionary Design** - Governance that adapts
6. **Indigenous Wisdom** - Honor First Nations leadership
7. **Regional Autonomy** - Local decisions stay local

### What We're NOT

- ❌ Voting on everything
- ❌ Bureaucratic committees
- ❌ Fixed rules forever
- ❌ ACT controlling

### What We ARE
- ✅ Collaborative network
