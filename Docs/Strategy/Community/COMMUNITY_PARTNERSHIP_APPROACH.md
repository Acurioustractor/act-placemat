# 🤝 ACT Intelligence Platform - Community Partnership Approach
## Building Genuine Relationships & Sustainable Community Capacity

---

## 🌱 OUR PHILOSOPHY

This platform isn't a product to sell - it's a tool for community empowerment. Our goal isn't to maximize revenue or create dependency. Instead, we want to:

- **Build genuine partnerships** based on shared values
- **Transfer knowledge and capacity** to communities
- **Work towards our own obsolescence** by empowering self-sufficiency
- **Support innovation and local job creation**
- **Grow together** as equals, not as vendor and client

## 💚 REFRAMING THE CONVERSATION

### Instead of "Demo to Prospects"
**"Sharing a Community Resource"**

"Hi Tara, we've been building something for the community - it connects all our collective knowledge and networks to help everyone win more grants. We've analyzed 15,000 connections and found incredible opportunities. Would love to show you how this could support Queensland Community Foundation's work and get your input on how to make it more useful."

### Instead of "Closing Deals"
**"Co-Creating Sustainable Support"**

"This platform costs us about $2,000/month to run and maintain. We're looking for a few community partners to share these costs while we train your team to eventually run similar systems independently. What would work for your organisation?"

### Instead of "Sales Targets"
**"Community Impact Goals"**

- Help 3 organisations win additional grants this month
- Train 5 community members in data intelligence
- Create 2 new local jobs in grant writing/data analysis
- Build capacity for long-term self-sufficiency

## 🤲 PARTNERSHIP CONVERSATION GUIDE

### Opening: Relationship First
"Before we look at any technology, tell me - what's the biggest challenge facing your community right now? What would real support look like for you?"

### Sharing the Tool: Community Asset
"We've built this by connecting everyone's knowledge - Ben and Nic's 15,000 LinkedIn connections, 347 stories from 191 storytellers. This belongs to all of us. Let me show you what we've discovered about grant opportunities for organisations like yours..."

### The Sustainability Question
"We want this to be sustainable but not extractive. The platform costs about $2,000/month to run. Some organisations contribute financially, others contribute stories or connections, some help train others. What feels right for you?"

### Building Capacity Together
"More importantly - we want to teach your team to do this themselves. Would you be interested in having someone from your organisation learn alongside us? They could become the grant intelligence expert for your region."

---

## 📊 SHARING THE PLATFORM (Not "Demos")

### Focus on Their Mission First
1. Ask about their current projects and challenges
2. Listen for where data/connections could help
3. Show relevant queries that solve THEIR problems
4. Explore together, don't perform

### Example Conversation Flow:
**You:** "What grants are you working on right now?"
**Them:** "We're struggling with the Knight Foundation application..."
**You:** "Let's explore that together. I'll search for stories that match their criteria..."
*Type query together, discover insights together*

### Make It Collaborative
- "What would you search for?"
- "Does this match your experience?"
- "How could we make this more useful?"
- "Who else should have access to this?"

---

## 💰 SUSTAINABLE ECONOMICS (Not "Pricing")

### Sliding Scale Model
Based on organisation capacity, not fixed pricing:

**Large Foundations ($10M+ budget)**
- $2,000-3,000/month contribution
- Helps subsidize smaller orgs
- Gets priority features/support

**Mid-Size Organisations ($1-10M budget)**
- $500-1,000/month contribution
- Or equivalent in-kind contribution
- Access to full platform

**Small Community Groups (<$1M budget)**
- $100-200/month or what they can afford
- Or contribute stories/connections
- Full access, community support

**Individual Grant Writers/Consultants**
- Skill exchange - they help others in return for access
- Build community capacity
- Create local employment

### Alternative Contributions
- Share grant-winning templates
- Contribute stories and impact data
- Train other organisations
- Provide feedback for improvements
- Connect us to other communities

---

## 🌏 BUILDING FOR OBSOLESCENCE

### Knowledge Transfer Plan
**Month 1-3:** We run queries, they watch and learn
**Month 4-6:** They run queries, we guide
**Month 7-9:** They train others in their network
**Month 10-12:** They're independent, maybe training others

### Creating Local Jobs
- Train local grant writers in AI tools
- Build data analysis skills in community
- Create "Community Intelligence Officer" roles
- Support innovation in grant seeking

### Open Source Eventually
- Document all processes
- Share methodologies freely
- Build community-owned alternatives
- Celebrate when they don't need us

## 🗣️ REAL CONVERSATION STARTERS

### For Queensland Community Foundation
"Tara, you're doing incredible work connecting donors to community needs. We've been mapping grant opportunities through our network and found some interesting patterns for Queensland. Could we explore these together and see if they're useful for your work?"

### For Children's Ground
"Stephen, your stories about indigenous programs are powerful. We've built a way to match these stories directly to grant requirements. But more importantly, we'd love to train someone from your team to do this independently. Interested in exploring?"

### For The Funding Network
"Isabel-Marie, you're already connecting funders to projects brilliantly. We've mapped 1,239 funding contacts that might help expand your network. Want to explore this together and see how we could make it useful for all the projects you support?"

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS (Community-Focused)

### What Success Really Looks Like:
- **Grants Won:** Not by us, but by communities
- **Capacity Built:** People trained, not platform users
- **Jobs Created:** Local employment in data/grants
- **Stories Shared:** Community voices amplified
- **Connections Made:** Networks strengthened
- **Independence Achieved:** Organisations self-sufficient

### Monthly Check-ins Focus On:
- "What did you learn?"
- "Who else could benefit?"
- "What capacity do you need?"
- "How can we work toward you not needing us?"

## 🤝 FOLLOW-UP (Relationship Nurturing)

### After Initial Conversation:
"Thanks for exploring this with us today. Whether or not you decide to contribute financially, you're welcome to use the platform for that Knight Foundation grant. Would you like me to run some queries for you?"

### Ongoing Support:
"How are things going with your grants? Any questions about the data we looked at? Would your team benefit from a training session?"

### Building Community:
"We're bringing together a few organisations next month to share grant strategies. Would you like to join? Queensland Community Foundation will be there..."

## 🌟 THE REAL VISION

We're not building a business - we're building a movement where:
- Communities own their own data and intelligence
- Local knowledge is valued and shared
- Capacity stays within communities
- Innovation happens at grassroots level
- We celebrate when communities don't need us anymore
- We move on to help others grow

**This is about human connection, community empowerment, and working ourselves out of a job by building others up.**

## 💚 REMEMBER

**We're not selling anything. We're sharing what we've built, learning what communities need, and figuring out together how to make the whole ecosystem stronger.**

The money isn't the goal - it's just what makes the work sustainable. The goal is community empowerment, shared success, and eventually, not being needed at all.

**That's true success.**
