# Theory of Change: ACT Goods Project
*Community Manufacturing for Essential Dignity*

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional Custodians in remote communities lack control over essential goods manufacturing, creating dependency on expensive, poor-quality products that fail quickly and don't meet cultural needs. This undermines community sovereignty while impacting health, dignity, and economic self-determination.
