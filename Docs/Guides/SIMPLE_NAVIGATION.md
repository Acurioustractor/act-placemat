## **🎯 WHAT EACH ONE DOES:**

## **🚀 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:**

1. **Daily Strategy Work:** Use the original placemat (`npm run dev` in main folder)

3. **Quick Switch:** Keep both URLs bookmarked for instant switching

**Both systems are independent - you can run them simultaneously or switch between them as needed!**
