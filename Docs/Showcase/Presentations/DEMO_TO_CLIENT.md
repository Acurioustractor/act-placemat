## 💰 The Close (2 minutes)

### Value Proposition
**You:** "Let me show you the math:"

| What They Get | Time/Value |
|--------------|------------|
| Grant research | 8 hours/month → 8 seconds |
| Financial analysis | 4 hours/month → 3 seconds |
| Strategic planning | 6 hours/month → 5 seconds |
| Report writing | 12 hours/month → 30 seconds |
| **Total Time Saved** | **30+ hours/month** |
| **Value at $150/hour** | **$4,500/month** |
| **Platform Cost** | **$2,000/month** |
| **Net Benefit** | **$2,500/month + grants** |

### The Close
**You:** "The platform costs $2,000 per month. Based on what you just saw, when would you like to start?"

### Handle Objections

**"It's expensive"**
> "You're right, $2,000 sounds like a lot. But you're currently spending $4,500 worth of time on these tasks. Plus, the first grant you win pays for 2 years of the platform. Would you rather keep spending 30 hours or 30 seconds on this work?"

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. While you're thinking, remember that Community Resilience Fund grant closes in 10 days. That's $35,000. If we start today, we can submit that application by Friday. Should we at least get that one submitted?"

**"How do I know it will work for my organization?"**
> "Great question. Let's do a 7-day pilot for $500. If you don't save at least 10 hours in the first week, I'll refund everything. Fair?"
