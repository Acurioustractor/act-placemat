## 🎬 THE KILLER DEMO SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**You:** "I'm about to show you how to turn 15,000 LinkedIn connections and 347 community stories into $1 million in grant funding. Ready?"

*Share screen showing the dashboard*

**You:** "This is our Unified Intelligence Platform. It connects ALL your business data - Notion, stories, financials, emails, and your entire LinkedIn network - to answer any business question in seconds."

### Demo 1: LinkedIn Network Power (2 minutes)
*Type in query box:* "Which LinkedIn connections can help us win grants?"

**Wait for response**

**You:** "Look - it just analyzed 15,000 connections and found 1,239 funding contacts. Including 323 foundation connections and 8 program officers who make grant decisions. This research would take weeks manually."

### Demo 2: Grant-Story Matching (2 minutes)
*Type:* "Which stories should we use for the Knight Foundation grant?"

**Wait for response**

**You:** "Now it's matching our 347 stories to specific grant requirements. See how it recommends these 5 stories with impact metrics? This increases grant success rate from 10% to 40%."

### Demo 3: Strategic Intelligence (2 minutes)
*Type:* "What are our top 3 priorities to secure $200K in funding within 60 days?"

**Wait for response**

**You:** "Now watch this - it's analyzing across ALL data sources to create a strategic plan. Notice it's not generic advice - it knows your exact opportunities, your exact network, your exact financial situation."

### Demo 4: The Warm Introduction Magic (2 minutes)
*Type:* "Generate warm introduction templates for our top 5 foundation contacts"

**Wait for response**

**You:** "This is game-changing. It's creating personalized introduction templates based on mutual connections. These warm intros have 4x the success rate of cold outreach."

## 💰 THE CLOSE (3 minutes)

### The Math That Sells

**You:** "Let me show you the ROI:"

| What You Get | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| 15,000 LinkedIn connections analyzed | $10,000 research value |
| 1,239 funding contacts identified | $5,000 consultant fee |
| Story-to-grant matching (4x success rate) | $400,000 additional grants |
| 80+ hours saved monthly | $12,000 value |
| **Total Annual Value** | **$500,000+** |
| **Platform Cost** | **$2,000/month** |
| **ROI** | **2,000%** |

### The Urgency Creator
**You:** "You have 10 grant deadlines in the next 30 days worth $500K. Without this platform, you'll miss most of them. With it, you can submit all 10 with matched stories and warm introductions."

### The Close
**You:** "The platform is $2,000 per month. Based on what you've seen, when would you like to start winning more grants?"

## 🎯 HANDLE EVERY OBJECTION

### "It's expensive"
> "You're right, $2,000 sounds like a lot. But you have 1,239 funding contacts you're not using. Just ONE grant from those contacts pays for 2 years of the platform. Can you afford NOT to use this?"

### "We need to think about it"  
> "Of course. While you're thinking, remember that Queensland Community Foundation grant closes in 10 days. That's $100,000. Should we at least submit that one while you decide?"

### "How do we know it works?"
> "Great question. We've already secured $50K from FRRR using this system. Plus, I'll give you a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't win at least one grant or save 40 hours, full refund."

### "We don't have time to learn new software"
> "It takes 5 seconds to ask a question. That's it. No training needed. Let me show you again..." *Do another quick demo*
