# ACT (A Curious Tractor) - Complete Overview Presentation

## 🚜 **Opening: Who We Are**

*"We're A Curious Tractor - cultivating seeds of impact through purposeful action."*

### **Our Mission**
Supporting grassroots communities and organizations to transform their inputs (knowledge, stories, programs) into living ecosystems where all participants are active contributors to growth.

### **Our Approach**
We've learned that the best solutions come from communities themselves. Our role is to provide tools, systems, and support that communities can own, control, and eventually operate independently.
