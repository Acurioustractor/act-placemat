# Goods. - Community Manufacturing Showcase

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Goods.** is revolutionizing essential product manufacturing by co-designing mattresses and washing machines from recycled plastic in Tennant Creek, with communities owning production and profits.

### **Core Promise**
*"Essential goods, community owned, locally made"*

## 📊 **Impact at a Glance**

### **Production Metrics**
- **160 mattresses** in community testing phase
- **5 indestructible washing machines** launched in Tennant Creek
- **Community co-design** based on 100+ resident interviews
- **Local plastic recycling** turning waste into manufacturing inputs
- **100% community ownership** of production and profits

### **Innovation Highlights**
- **Recycled materials** - Local plastic waste becomes product inputs
- **Community specifications** - Products designed by users, for users
- **Ownership model** - Communities retain manufacturing and profit control
- **Circular economy** - Waste reduction + economic opportunity

## 💬 **Community Voices**

### **From Tennant Creek Residents:**
*"These mattresses were designed by us, for us. They last longer than anything we've bought before and the money stays in our community."* - Local Resident

### **From Manufacturing Team:**
*"When you design with the community instead of for them, you create products that actually work and last."* - Goods. Production Lead

### **From Environmental Impact:**
*"We're not just solving the mattress problem, we're turning our plastic waste into an economic opportunity."* - Community Environmental Champion

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
