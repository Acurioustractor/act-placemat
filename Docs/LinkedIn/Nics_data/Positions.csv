Orange Sky Australia,Co-Founder ,"When I was in high school my best mate Lucas and I volunteered on a food van operated by our school in Brisbane, Australia supporting people experiencing homelessness. We noticed that while there were lots of vans offering food, drinks, health checks, support and companionship there was one thing missing. There was no mobile free laundry service for people experiencing homelessness.   People using the vans had to use expensive Laundromats, try and access laundry services through short-term shelters or go without. They spoke of a loss of dignity and respect and poorer health through not being able to regularly wash clothing and other personal items.   In 2014, when Lucas and I were 20 years old we decided to change that and build a free mobile laundry van. In September 2014, our old van Sudsy was transformed and Orange Sky the charity was born.  Since then we've been working hard with our team of incredible staff, 2000+ volunteers, incredible supporters and service providers to support our friends (people experiencing homelessness) to positively connect with communities across Australia and New Zealand.  To date Orange Sky Australia has provided ● over 280 shifts and 32 services in every state and territory each week ● completed more than 1.2 million kilograms of washing; ● provided more than 12,700 warm showers; and ● most importantly, fostered over 207,000 hours of genuine and non-judgemental conversation on our six orange chairs.  I am always keen to connect with people who are passionate about making a difference and/or working with Orange Sky so please get in touch or find out more here - https://orangesky.org.au/",Australia,Jul 2014,
Best Friends Weddings with Gambino ,Civil Marriage Celebrant ,"Hey Friends, I'm Gambino, a civil marriage celebrant. Ever wanted to be married by a goofy groodle? Look no further!  It was one of my first ideas when my best friend Lucas asked if I could help him marry his best friend Matilda.   ""If only I could hide behind Gambino!""  In all seriousness though, what's better than marrying your best friend, or your best friend's best friend, than being able to marry them both? So, I am now an authorised marriage celebrant.  I have a few ideas on how to approach this new career:  do it with Gambino, take people into nature to reflect and connect together,  or specialise in 2nd and 3rd weddings......  Who knows what it becomes, but let's give it a go! Find out more here:  https://lnkd.in/gwufhNxC",Australia,Apr 2025,

Olive Express,Conductor In Residence,"A few months back, a mysterious card appeared on my desk. It was from the founders of Olive Express, Kim Chatterjee and Che Turner. Curiosity I visited their website and was instantly captivated. Inspired by their elder loved ones who cherished train journeys, they transformed an old van into an immersive virtual train experience for those who could no longer travel. The impact, however, stretches far beyond the screens displaying scenic journeys—it's about bringing joy, awe, nostalgia, and connection to our elders.     Since launching, requests have poured in from across the country, eager for the unique experience Olive Express offers. The vision? To expand this mission nationwide, utilising their vans, a dedicated team of volunteers, and the power of connection, even as the virtual train rolls on.    I'm excited to announce that I have joined Olive Express as their voluntary ""Conductor In Residence,"" in collaboration with A Curious Tractor. My role is to help amplify this incredible mission and expand its impact throughout Australia.    If you're inspired to join this journey, reach out. I'm looking forward to welcoming you aboard.

OnlyT,Vice Presidentee - Relationships,"Only T is Queensland's newest creative social experience and the world's first tee shirt brewhouse. The brainchild of three young Brisbane men, Only T's weekly tee parties give Brisbanites the unique opportunity to 'brew' their very own customised tee shirts and pots whilst enjoying some drinks and socialising with good company. Whether you're in the mood for a Peppermint tee with Juan or a White Jasmine bubble tee, a night at the Only T brewhouse in Windsor is all about rolling up your sleeves and having a laugh while you get your hands dirty. By the end of the night you'll be armed with your very own customised tee shirt and tee pot (concrete planter) to take home in a unique Gold Coast-produced tee bag. It may be the world's first tee shirt brewhouse, but no experience is necessary to be a sommelier at Only T - just grab an apron and get ready to get creative (and have a few drinks while you're at it). Only T's brewhouse is BYO, so why not skip your night out at the bar and get brewing instead?","Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2017,Aug 2021
