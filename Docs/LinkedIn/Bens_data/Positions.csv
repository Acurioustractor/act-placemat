Knight Photography,Photographer,"My aim is to create images with a connection. It doesn’t have to be a great pose, beautiful lighting or the best equipment; just connection with the lens, the situation they are in, a person or even a thought.   I am currently working on a project capturing people in their homes. I want to create stunning images of people ‘just hanging out’ frozen in the most comfortable of arenas. I want picture of mum making a cake with their first born, families running in the sprinkler on a hot day or even sitting in a favourite cuddle couch. Photography is more than just a smiling family, it’s about a split second in your life when nothing mattered but that moment.",Brisbane,Jan 2013,
