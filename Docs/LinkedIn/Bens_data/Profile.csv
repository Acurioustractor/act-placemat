Benjamin,Knight,,,"Apr 25, 1981",Leads with energy and values relationships over profit and growth,"I believe in the power of storytelling to spark change. My journey has taken me from the bustling street markets of Ecuador to the resilient communities within Bolivian prisons. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that the essence of human connection transcends borders and cultures.  With a career spanning roles as a brand manager, professional photographer, youth advocate, and more, my passion lies in fostering community and creating impactful narratives. Whether I’m capturing moments through my lens or facilitating programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, my mission is to amplify voices and drive meaningful change.  At AIME, I lead the Design Studio with a focus on integrating Indigenous systems thinking and mentoring marginalised youth. My work is fuelled by the belief that every story matters and that empathy, innovation, and resilience are the pillars of transformative action.  Join me as I continue to explore the uncharted territories of human connection and storytelling, turning challenges into opportunities and fostering a world where every voice is heard.",Business Consulting and Services,4103,Greater Brisbane Area,[benknightphoto],"[COMPANY:www.act.place,BLOG:www.yjustice.org]",
