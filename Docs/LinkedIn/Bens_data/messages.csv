Your post about youth detention really caught my eye. It is such a tragedy perpetuating the intergenerational trauma creating by colonisation and a F$&@ economic model that values GDP more than wellbeing. We are in the process of partnering at home to bring indigenous and other young people to the land to help their growth and healing. I see you are connected with our son @Jamie Thompson.

I work in business development with Martu people in the Western Desert and Kimberley. We work on country developing strong and trusted relationships with people which allows for an approach walking alongside individuals and businesses with the model of business benefiting community. I struggle a lot with the use of stories. Stories are shared with us as a way for the individual or community to communicate their lives, their hopes, visions and experience and it is an ongoing and unfolding process over time.  The tension is between sharing stories of the work we do and meeting the needs of the organization I currently work for which is generally a western market type situation and the cultural use of storytelling in developing deep relationships and assisting us in understanding how we as the as the people on the ground can work better. I find the same with images. In the marketing and social media space my current experience is of organizations frequently co opting ""storytelling"" to allow the use stories and images for our own purposes - often with good intention - but without exploring how we can work together to understand the deeper concept in culture and community and work towards something different. Nothing new here but good to hear you articulate this.  I am I look forward to hearing more about your exploration - I think there is space for something new to come through in the  marketing space - it already is in film/TV/literature and art and in some ways social media through communities use of FB and other platforms in digital storytelling. Anyway, as with many things it is a great concept to be exploring here. Thanks again for your posts - sharing your experiences and thoughts with others experiencing similar things is helpful. Have a great day. Warm regards Brigitte",INBOX,,No

This year we are doing Couture Fashion Week in Paris and a colab for Carla Zampatti’s 60th Anniversary.   Imagine if we had a Youth Strategy in this space? We have our own…  Thanks both for responding. It’s a good stepping stone. ",INBOX,,No

I hope you're both well. I've been following the conversations from a distance re: justice reinvestment and Youth issues in our Region and a lot of the main players aren't even at the Table.   When you look at the Gulf Rugby League Teams as an example - the majority of the Young People 16+ live and breath the lack of opportunities and the opportunities but the ""experts"" are still having the conversations about us without us. Brodie I was thinking in the future a summit/camp for our Communities led by Community to direct change from our lived experiences, past and present but also guide what that looks like. E.g. We need a simple dry season, wet season approach as well.   All the research has been done from Community Safety Plans, Audits, Strategic Plans, Recommendations etc. If you look at the ""Keeping on Country Report"" the findings and recommendations are quite simple but no one has taken this on board. I've been doing the majority of work already but the Report has reinforced my thinking and delivery.   If you take a look at how CLCAC run their Ranger Forums - it clearly demonstrates that a Forum of this size and of importance can be held on home soil.  If each Community had their own small Forum and then came together once every year or biannually it could change the narrative. This is how we ran the RL Competition back in the day. The current Battle of the Gulf relates to the Competition but we need a vision beyond that.   The last QRL Remote Rugby League Forum didn't address any of our issues and it won't.

Beyond auspicing, if there are any opportunities for us to work together on a project, please don't hesitate to get in touch.   Safe travels back to Mt Isa and please let me know if you are in Sydney in the future. We work out of Yirranma Place, the PRF building where Philanthropy Australia is housed, and lots of foundations, and you'd be welcome to come hang with us here and grab a coffee. That said, we work pretty flexibly, so also happy to grab a coffee somewhere in the city that's more convenient.  It was really nice meeting you last night. If I don't chat with you again soon, I hope you and your family have a wonderful festive season.  All the best  Jen (I don't check LinkedIn super often, so please drop me a line at jennifer.jones@sefapartnerships.org.au)",INBOX,,No

If I can tee it up with one of my Programs I would definitely meet you out there.   At the moment I'm hoping to get two to three gigs before Christmas to keep my head above water. One is on hold due to the rain in the Cape but I might be doing something with NWRH (Day Programs) due to the weather this time of the year.   I got a few swags donated to me from the Program out on Gununa and talking to a Company in Cairns who will buy them so I can give the money back into the Swag Program.   I have developed a Therapeutic Program to run alongside the Swag Making for the Women and the Men which I will flesh out with the Makers and the Community.   How have you been Bro?

This will be the foundation and soft entry approach to introducing the Men's Retreat.   I have also had conversations with PNG Sports Federation and Port Moresby Vipers RL Club to implement something similar in Papua New Guinea but aimed at Gender Violence and Player Welfare and an education pathway system.   We are now working on an exchange Program. I've rolled up the swag and packed my swimmers. I'm excited to see my land and start working with the RL Team and Rangers to clear it and get it ready for the winter/dry season Camps.  I have two Ambassadors now who will be supporting how we roll out as I'm sure the model will spread into the lower Gulf and we want it to be Community led.   Hope all is well.",INBOX,,No

Admire your strength and resilience through this chapter. I appreciate Josh and Kate you are probs smashed but would love to share a quick thought. Ben and I have been working on this model around using story alongside blockchain tech to capture thematics and also protect story holders wishes in a project called empathy ledger. The idea being we use methods of voice, photo, video, drawing to capture people’s story and at the point of collection capture a record of how they would like the story told, consent, licensing, reporting etc. this is then embedded into the story as meta data (like how photos now you can search location, faces etc) so when they story is used we do it in the right way.   Ben and I have been connecting with story holders around the country in the forms of Orange Sky, Justice and product innovation and have noticed a gap in doing this right  I don’t want to overcommit but would love the idea of us helping capture these artefacts with you and testing this concept with the archives.

I have a very keen interest in putting this juvenile justice bullshit to bed. My childhood best friend has a child with usher syndrome and so she’s grown her boy to be 15 years old now and she’s watched him slowly go death over the years and the behavioural problems that came with it or the misinformation. The misunderstandings, People thinking that he was rude ignoring them and so she wrote a paper on Aboriginal health and she found that 95% of juveniles in the north territory considering 100% in the system are aboriginal had a hearing impairment.   We all know that over policing and impatient police and their overt racism are the main factors that take Aboriginal children into custody, but without putting any of the onus on Aboriginal children imagine from the view of the police officer that says stop the kid doesn’t hear them. Imagine them ignoring police or not hearing an order. Ottis media is found to affect Aboriginal people the most in the world. If untreated it causes deafness. 20% are deaf in Victorian prisons. And the numbers higher due to racism staff not wanting tonsfreen them or doing shitty screenings and passing them.   Food for thought. ",INBOX,,No

I really connected with your recent post on kids in detention centres. Please reach out any time to chat or collaborate. I like to try & solve wicked problems & have a positive impact on kids & the community so this sparked my interest. Other areas I’ve been looking at recently include gender equality in schools & youth homelessness. Your post to me resonated like a call to action - maybe we could get some clever people together for a think tank?  I also do a variety of coaching & HR consulting corporately, mostly people focused. I’m mainly just a passionate dad trying to make a positive impact. The more I dig the more I discover so many more issues with our school system including intersectional & funding inequities. For example the sexualisation & objectification of girls through sports uniforms. Or how can we justify as a society giving rich kids billions for state of the art sports facilities while other kids sleep on the street.  I’m based in Toowoomba. All the best, Mark 😊",INBOX,,No

You got some good connections or tips re working with community to align the community thoughts / issues to?  I can also try and run up there for the day or do virtual stuff to try and get the vibes.  Mainly need a few community leaders / thoughts to add to the grant submission.  The idea would be to get Confit Mentors up there x3 times and then link them to digital mentoring / trial some trips down to Sydney for young people who engage with the experience.  https://desbt.qld.gov.au/youth-justice/partnerships/grants/community-crime-action,INBOX,,No

I was introduced to Joe via one of the boys I grew up with (Nick Houlis). We had a meeting and discussed CF providing fitness to our youth program in community but someone got sick so they pulled out and said they'd come back to us. Nick departed and I never heard back from Joe. Nick reached out to follow up after leaving but still never heard back from Joe.   I reached out to April Long (end of last year I think) to advise her of above and still keen to partner. Nothing.  Reached out to Hamilton either last week or week before and still nothing.  Not the best way to build community partnerships tbh.  I have ideas for collaboration and we're ready to partner but professional relationships with mob need to be reciprocal and I'm not seeing that here.   We are aligned with CF mission and support their work but either people see the value of our partnership and will prioritise that or they don't.  I appreciate you reaching out and would be keen to have a yarn still but def a learning curve for CF in working with the Aboriginal Community and ACCOs.  ",INBOX,,No

To analyse the de-securitisation of human trafficking victims between Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand. How the perspective of the camera lens, the power dynamic, the object of security and every element of communication shapes the security of what is being communicated. Upto the highest levels of the foreign office conferences in ASEAN. And down to the corrupt camps on borders.   ^^ I would so love to do something again.

Maybe you go back to the team and explain your options, give clear directions to why you did that and engage in a discussion about the opportunities, risks and creative ways to share stories that will not adversely affect the storyteller.  There are also times where you need to go with your gut and work out yourself what are the risks and opportunties in telling the storey and then make efforts to connect back with an individual. Part of the journey might even be sharing their story so that you can reconnect and find out more ways to help / find out how to fullfil the storytellers opportunity to either say they dont wish to share or they want to share more.

If she is keen I'd suggest she start listening to The Undercover Architect podcast https://undercoverarchitect.com/podcast/ & Live Life Build on Youtube, who are Builders Coaches including Amelia from UA, to gain some insights into the beast & have eyes wide open.   Building is wonderful rewarding and a joy but can equally be extremely stressful if you don't have your ducks in a row or work for a shitty company.

You truly write beautifully, that’s one skill I hope AI doesn’t weaken further in humans given AI has cracked the language code for connection.

Looking like you are doing some amazing work and in a network with a few of my old haunts.  The reason for the message is that I am working on some justice digital disruption through building apps/digital experience for some rad areas (Confit, ACT Drug Court etc.) and a different way to do storytelling.  I am reaching out to people that might be interested in hearing about this idea called 'Empathy Ledger'. The main concept is to support people doing it tough to own their stories that get used for organizational marketing in charities and the for-profit sector. Think of it like licensing and agency support for people doing it tough.  I am considering smart contracts, AI for legal and other areas at the moment but the main thing is bringing power and revenue to the storyteller.  Well - that's the pitch ;)  Sure you are busy so only touch base if you think its rad.  Stay well. BK",INBOX,,No

I wonder if you could engage one/some of the women to help in the design/ideation?  The thing most people get wrong is starting without thinking of the audience and what they want on there. Key is to keep it simple and then leave space to keep iterating/build on something where you have the power to change yourself. Dont get stuck into a contract with someone who charges for each change.  I do this stuff all the time so happy to keep feeding ideas.  I added a few templates that help with my thinking/building in the link below. If you have a Notion account you could copy it all over, or just steal the concepts.  https://acurioustractor.notion.site/Future-of-Corrections-Website-Resources-0186f6fccd654d06aae05d1d65342e7e  If ya ever wanna brainstorm face to face let me know.   If ya just want us to build it, super happy to as well, especially if there was an opportunity to mentor someone at same time.  I am drafting this one up with Joe atm - more a feature and pitch deck type thing but fun.  This is the type of style I am digging atm.

I'm pretty new to Cognizant myself so not sure what their appetite is for this stuff, but it might be worth a shot asking? Pratibha that's been on some of the calls leads the Outreach team here for APAC so if there's anyone to chat with, she'd the the best point of call - might be worthwhile running a program by her? I'm always keen on keen on helping out in an advisory capacity, but if you're after a decent chunk of commitment you'd need someone like Pratibha to convince the powers.  Another way to run the program might be to engage them in ""hack days"" type approach where they can timebox say 2 days, pull in a whole bunch of people, and see what creative solutions they can pull together in those days.  Hope the chats were helpful - have a good xmas and break as well mate.   Cheers",INBOX,,No

Context is that I spun these up over two different mornings by myself so all feedback is super great.  To be honest man, it just sucks that not for profits can't get talent like yourself to make apps and tools great. We have had support from Salesforce, Atlassian and now this one with volunteer days/programs but what it really takes is teams to commit to a project with the same outcomes as the ones they are running at.  Hope that doesn't sound like a rant but I would love to mock up a volunteer program that is about action and not the report that the org puts out at the end of the year with a couple of sessions.  Your skills are obviously so rad and exactly what we need - is there any world that we could pitch to Cognizant to trial something if we put something forward?  Here are the things I want to build in 2022: * Mentor App - learn to mentor disadvantaged kids * AIME Productions (Video) - Blockchain App * Jobs Board - supported by Seek * Impact calculator app   I think the only think stopping us is great code/project skills.

Overall the sites look great, you've done an awesome job to pull this together, particularly because you've no-code coded it all yourself! It's impressive stuff.  Few comments from me below just doing a pass through for you to consider. Just did a quick 30min run through so please excuse me if I've misunderstood some of it.  Cheers, Reuben   **Experience** - Be clear about who the audiences and who it's for. For example, if there's some content for mentors, some for kids, and some that's suited for both, consider the experience and interactions to suit both. The more targeted the experience (from landing through to content), the higher the engagement is going to be. If you can tailor the UX pathways to be specific for each of the segment groups it'll be easier for each group to be able to complete their goal (goal being accessing the content) - Metadata is a key for SEO. You have heaps of unique content, make sure it's doing as much as it can. I know a lot of the content links off to other providers or content distribution platforms (which is fine as it lightens the load on your servers), but if you can start to progressively tag the previews/content blocks with the meta data which will bump your SEO. - The category/topic filter/sorting is a bit scattered. A quick sorting [UX activity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/) might help to identify the appropriate mental models for each audience group (kids, mentors, etc). This will help the experience, make it easier for people to find what they need   **Foundation** - The performance is a bit heavy at the moment (on [https://aimelibrary.softr.app/](https://aimelibrary.softr.app/)). It loads a total of 145mb, with some individual gifs taking up to 13mb. While this isn't an issue for us living in metro cities, I suspect a large portion of your target audience may be located in regional towns, some may only have access to 4G mobile data which means the page could take up to 3-5mins to load. I'd look to either pause, or only take smaller, resized or static versions of the previews to lighten this. For context you want to main to have your website load under 20mb. Another way is to have the site load progressively (think social media), where it loads say a small portion, then you have to scroll to the bottom and it loads more later), or to just add pagination and load only say 10 at a time. - To view network and performance (above), just open up chrome, hit F12 > Network and then reload - Site site is currently loading stuff sequentially which is great - content up top comes first, then the previews. What you want to look for here is to make sure that' you're prioritising the key stuff first, and/or that the loading is happening either in parallel, or sequenced in a way that makes sense. - Could add login, but I'd ask the question - what do you need to protect or what's the key reason you need it? Each step/click you ask people to take drops click conversion, so a firewall may actually hinder your goal. I do think there's a conversion play, where you ask just for an email (rather than login) to view - could strike a balance between collecting (and then nurturing) potential mentors, vs usability and seamless access to content. Of course, if you have stuff that would require a login then that makes sense (self-service account stuff) - Accessibility - not sure how differently abled your audience might be, but something to consider is making your site WCAG compliant. This will just mean your site is more open to those who might have more challenges navigating your site (i.e. can't use a mouse, visually impaired, etc). It is a lot of work tho so I would deprioritise this if you don't think it's applicable. - I'd recommend configuring knowledge base platform (i.e. Freskdesk, wix, even notion?). While they'll come at a cost, you'll save heaps of time from trying to build/configure your own version of these in a no-code environment. This will free up your time to spend on more important things (maximising use from your content, focusing on conversion, etc) rather than trying to code it yourself. It will also bring a tonne of features (SMS, automation, reporting, contract management, collaboration, service desk/ticketing, etc) that will take you awhile to build yourself, as well as some cool next level things like AI chat bots (i.e. features that can use your data to auto-build a chatbot for you). At the end of the day, you aren't a tech company, so it would be an ineffective use of your effort and time to spend building custom features (which equates to $). Your specialist skill is your ability to leverage tech knowledge to enable the organisation to run and scale.",INBOX,,No

Have a bunch of questions about a online tool i am thinking of developing and need to know things about logistics.    The easiest way to explain it is like a social media/information tool for the homeless and disadvantaged. Would have lists of accommodation, support services, way to communicate with others and maybe even someway NGO's could tap into it and use it as some kind of case management tool. Would also be putting videos, stories, pictures of good things happening in the homeless community.    There is nothing like this around and they are just starting to do similar things in the US.    The thing is i don’t know how to start and what the possibilities are. I could get a grant pretty easy i think but that limits my options into the future.    Do you think there are others ways to make it sustainable i.e. advertising, money contracts from other companies?     I have all the information, contacts, knowledge to make it happen but have no idea what i am doing developing the IT stuff.    Are there people around that would want to help develop something like this in more of a partnership than a one off payment. Just don’t want to unload a bunch of cash and then find out there is no way to make it sustainable.    That is just an outline. Flick us you number if you have time for a chat.    Yep, still in Brisbane with a mortgage, 8 month year old girl and working for the Government, so need a bit of excitement.    Hope all is well with you and your project and keeping you honest.

Your message is below. Let me know how you would like to connect.  Talk soon  Hi Michael S., My name is Natalie MacDonald, and I'm a LinkedIn editor covering the Australian bushfires.  More than $200 million has been raised by business, celebrities, philanthropists and the public in support of those affected by the bushfire crisis.  But donating and fundraising in the face of any crisis can be a complex endeavour. Red tape and legal concerns over how funds will be spent have complicated the task of distributing the cash.  As someone in the industry, I want to know more about your experience. How do charities decide what and where resources are needed most? How do you manage public expectations and keep their attention after the headlines vanish and the camera crews pack up? What’s your advice to those who wish to help?  I’d love to get your thoughts in a comment on this post, where you’ll find other industry experts chiming in on the subject. I hope to use the insights for the next edition of my newsletter Food For Thought.  Thanks and I look forward to reading your response!  Natalie MacDonald News Editor",INBOX,,No

I am writing to ask for a favour. A few years ago I took the leap and self-published a comic book called Maurice & The Metal - it's a story of a slacker kid who discovers he has impossible strength whenever he listens to heavy metal.  But now I need your help to keep the dream alive and bring Issue 2 to life! I have created a Kickstarter campaign as it costs a lot to create a comic book, all funds raised will go directly to the illustrator and the printing of the book, and if I cannot reach my target the project won’t be funded at all. So I really need your help to get the campaign to 100%.  Check it out here - www.kickstarter.com/projects/sammut-aaron/maurice-and-the-metal-issue-2  It would mean so much to me if you could contribute any amount possible towards this project, there are packages on the Kickstarter, $18 will get you both Issue 1 and Issue 2 in print.  I am so passionate about getting this story told. Please help me bring this story to life. Everything I do on this project is fueled by a passion to tell this story! I appreciate anything you can do, pass on to friends, share the campaign, it all helps.  Thanks so much for your ongoing support for this project!  All the best,  Aaron",INBOX,,No

Just to touch on one of the speakers for the day. Author of 'Courage to Change' and 'Stop Playing Safe'. Margie Warrells' take on leadership and progression in life I have found to be so refreshing. Raised in rural Australia, and having travelled the world interviewing with top leaders, she delivers the ideas garnered throughout the years in such a raw and humble fashion. Both these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_FUC3EL2GI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_VjWY_BLbw video clips show what I mean.  We face challenges on a daily basis, and these challenges take us in one of two directions. We need to allow ourselves 'time out' to clarify what it is we really want, and then build it into our future. Seating is limited, and is by invitation only. Let me know and I can send through the details. I look forward to the opportunity of meeting with you face to face, it would be great to introduce you to some of my connections there, and see what collaborations are possible.

Rob focuses on human behaviour as the foundation of Leadership. And as we know, leadership skills are becoming more important in today’s connection economy.   Some of the topic being covered are ~  `What type of businesses & career strategies make sense in the current environment  `What can we learn from successful disruptive business models such as  `AirBNB & Uber   `Why we need to prioritise the important – especially health and nutrition . `Thinking fresh and being a Go Giver   `The power of making the right connections   Seating is limited, and is by invitation only.

I have been ramping up my festival coverage of late and supporting acts like Holy Holy, RUFUS and Regurgitator produce engaging content.  I am interested to hear about opportunities to support the coverage of Forgotten Island and get more Aussies to take up the journey. I have traveled on Gili a few times now and find it an idealistic place perfect for an opportunity such as this.  There are a few different options for my involvement that includes coverage in a number of different publications such as The Music, Scenestr and Rolling Stone. Also access to a number of media publication through my work with Diimex.  Also happy to just come on board as an official photographer and cover the event.

I run a small charity called PIIP. We’re based in Sydney, Australia.  PIIP organises internships and traineeships in the creative industry.   I'm writing to ask if you would like to sit on the judging panel of a web/TV series competition? Judging will be online.  The competition is part of an industry screen accelerator program, billed MAKERS, which will pilot in Sydney in late 2016. MAKERS will promote collaboration between creatives, publishers, broadcasters, music executives, agencies, producers and brands around brand-funded entertainment. My objective with MAKERS is to produce a slate of screen properties into whose production I place interns through PIIP.  Does this sounds interesting?  If so, I have prepared a draft prospectus. Could I send it to you?  Best Claude     0411 739 811   claude@piip.org.au",INBOX,,No

Here is a link to the video;  https://youtu.be/qkSVqQX9-hg  This follows a string of recent awards and accolades amassed by the group, including being crowned winners for the internationally hotly regarded ‘Hard Rock Rising 2015’ awards which took place at the iconic Hard Rock Cafe London, being ‘Finalist’ in UpriseFM’s ‘Live In Your City’, as well as winning a recording with the highly acclaimed John Davenport (John Lennon, Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen) at Deep River Studios in North Carolina; producing the phenomenal ‘Choices’ which very recently reached number one in the Reverbnation indie charts.  'I Should've Known' follows the success of Narrow Plains previous single, ‘So Rewind’ which ended up being hand-picked by the BBC as ‘Record Of The Day’ earlier last year. 'I Should've Known' runs on a strong blues/rock influence, as brothers; Roger Connick (bass) and Stuart Connick (drums) lay down a tireless and hypnotic rhythm, allowing vocalist and frontman Charlie Ferriday to really push his distinctive vocals over the persistence of his ruthless guitar playing.  Narrow Plains continue to succeed in whatever comes their way. With their much anticipated self-titled album just round the corner set for release on the 14th of February and a prior release show on the 22nd of January at the O2 Academy Islington, Narrow Plains is one to watch for 2016, as they storm the music industry with an attitude that just won’t stop.

Essentially, we offer simple video options for our customers and a number of possible extras, which can be found on our website www.realvidmarketing.com     If you are looking to sell a property, or know someone who is, please feel free to contact us for more information.

I don't have any gigs lined up for next year, but I have been playing as a duo with a friend, so let's see what 2015 brings.    I've been working as a designer for years and teaching design as well, and the best advice I can give you for branding is ""go for it!"". Spend the money and get the best branding/logo design that you can, it will portray your business as professional. Your brand is everything - it's not just the logo but the service you are offering as well. Start with a logo and business card for networking and then develop a website. Then create a database of potential clients and you can email them with ""specials"" (i.e.: In the month of January, you can save $ if you book a shoot etc). If you have at least that as your marketing tool you will start to attract more clients. People want to see your photographic work and a website is the best idea!     Have a look at the below link as it has some interesting tips:    http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/marketing/marketing-strategy/branding/ten-ways-to-build-a-brand-for-your-small-business    I like the images you took at The Hits and Somejerks gig too :))    Thanks,  Heli.

We now have over 500 Australian contributors registered on the platform and 1,500 globally.     We are getting more and more requests to cover stories in both metropolitan and rural areas as you can see from the examples below. Please remember that WE DO NOT OFFER SUBSCRIPTION PRICING so most of these stories have sold in the thousands of dollars with some in the tens of thousands when sold globally and the CONTRIBUTOR RECEIVES 75% of all sales. We now have over 10,000 editors around the world receiving our new content alerts.     Whilst our coverage is good in certain areas, it is a big country and there are a lot which we have not been able to get to. As such we are looking to expand the number of contributors we have across Australia.     As we continue to grow we are getting more and more requests to cover particular stories. This will include commissioned work as well as stories done on speculation and even paparazzi style. This includes breaking news, weather, features, portraits, property, animals and quirky stories. There is particular interest for Australiana.     Below we have listed some examples of the stories we have sold to the world’s largest news website, the mailonline. We have limited our examples to this website for ease of reference. These and many others have been sold to media companies both in Australia and around the world. This should give you an idea of the type of content we are after. PRINTED CONTENT EXAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE, https://www.facebook.com/diimex.media?ref=ts&fref=ts     Please note that the quicker you upload the content the better the chance of selling it and the more money you are likely to receive. A lot of photographers are now uploading directly from the scene over wifi networks.     We are currently developing some exciting technology which will make the commissioning process very easy. In order to qualify for this type of work you will need to be registered and you will have to have accurate contact details entered.     If you have already registered we ask you to please log on to the Diimex site and complete your personal details if you have not done so. This will allow us to know where you are based so we can contact you for specific jobs. If you have not registered and are interested in selling content to the World’s media please go to www.diimex.com. If you have any friends that are professional photographers / videographers looking for work please pass on our details and ask them to register.     We look forward to working together very soon.

I have been following Diimex for a while now but unsure as to how best integrate into the sevice. Have been shooting for a while now and ready to get into some more gritty photojournalism.  Was lucky enough to have some photos shown at the latest Walkey slidenight in Brisbane (http://walkleys.com/winners-photo-highlights-brisbane-slide-night/) and would love to capitialise on the exposure, especially if it was around more access to larger music events. Want to cover more stories around the music rather than just pic sof people performing.  I am also one of two photographers working on an exhibition titled ""Her past is not her future'. It involves pictures of 11 women that have been supported out of the sex industry and meant to normalize and push women to find support if they are in simialr situations. It is due for exhibition early February and will be shown at Brisbane City Hall.  Not sure for the reason for the message really, just trying to work out if any this photojournalism stuff is worth pursuing and if i have the ability to push some work through Diimex.

Looking for anything cool you might have coming up we can feature in the launch of our new media project.    Here is an email i have been sending out to my contacts that will give you a bit of an idea of what we are up to.    Keen to see if you have something that fits.    Hey …..,    Just a quick note to advise that I have officially forgone my role as Editor of MouthZoff Magazine to pursue a more focused approach to supporting the music industry as a whole.    I have been spending a lot of time researching the music media formula and believe it is time for something distinctive. I understand the need for music news, reviews, gig guides and competitions but think the audience is ready to dig a bit deeper and experience another layer of what goes in the music world.   I also believe there are some amazingly talent individuals writing, taking photos and more generally supporting the music industry craving more investigative journalism, photo documentary pieces and know how to make a living out of their work. Therein lies the inspiration for the birth of wordsimagesmusic.     WordsImagesMusic was created by a photographer (myself) and a writer who want to dig deep into Brisbane’s (and the world’s) creativity, who want to go past the here and now, the latest single, the new album, last night’s show.     WIM intends to work in together with a technology partner to create a community where the people in, on and near the action can tell their stories and build relationships through their creative projects, teaching, learning and collaboration.     There will be a lot more info available over the next few months as the business progresses.

I'm always keen on networking with new people and working together.  We do a lot of weddings and corporate work with our bands and artists at the moment and are really starting to expand the business. (Website is about 8 years old so don't go by that haha)  We also currently book resident live music in some of Brisbane finest venues including Cloudland, Press Club, Empire Hotel, Caxton Street just to name a few. We use these venues as a platform to promote our bands as well as other services.   I'm all about word of mouth and cross promotion with my venues/artists/service providers, so I'm interested in working with you to help promote each other.  We're currently doing up a new website which will feature some of our recommended service providers. Send me some info on yourself and any promo you would like to use and I can look into promoting it.   Feel free to come along to some of our live gigs and take some shots. Would be great to meet you in person and show you how we work. You can find out when our live gigs are by checking our Facebook page. Please feel free to like and share the page too ;)  www.facebook.com/sessionsentertainmentqld  I'm going to start featuring service providers on this page as I expect to grow an audience of corporate event planners, wedding planners, brides to be and people who just love the live music scene.
