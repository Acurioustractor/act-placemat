Bigger ACT picture

The PTO amplified

We have the ability to support grassroots communities and organisation to think abbot their inputs (knowledge, stories and programs) and turn nit into living ecosystems where all people engaged are activity participants in growth.We have worked out some nice patterns in talking to people and giving them database entries that they own - this is their story and they have agency over it but it synced to a greater whole.

We have built a system for ACT where we have a strategy back end to store all projects and process that links to our operations and supports community understanding, revenue, project work and is feed by Notion.

There is then a Supabase database that supports all of our stories from teh projects we work in and this ensures that we set them up in teh right way through the Empathy Ledger methodology.

We then use all this data to feed the front end and roll up the right stories, project details and community member snacks supports so that they can see what. They are contributing too, partner can see what we are woking on and we can link this to future potential partners and anyone can see the areas we are focused on , teh communities we work in and the different areas we are focused on.

We can do the same for a number of partners so that they can have website dashboards that they can update - that we can support with content and that they can continue to find ways to share updates, link to their strategy and compete with systems that are forcing them out of economic opportunities and growth potential. This is about aligning communities to existing tools that support them to have the resources and practices to compete with systems and larges organisations that have worked out the logic to growth and maintaining power over resources and relationships.

We can support with modules like community voices, content management, project scoping, impact through stories, dashboards and website design and hosting.

The idea is that we can use our energy and resources to help power communities and then as we build this community and network we share the work with our broader community of philanthropy and businesses so that they can understand the best back for their buck and they can find areas and actions that are occurring around the world where they fit with there values and methodology.

Now we have to think about what ar the forces that are currently stopping this from happening and lean into eh tools and actions that support changes - where we sit as supporters and why we are not creating another charity - we want to power teh change that is already occurring - we want that change to link to other people to received energy case study, tools and frameworks so that the change is coming form the community up.

Then people that should be worried are those that are using extractive practices in community and gatekeeping knowledge and guides were the community can work to help themselves. We want to move away from western extractive and secret clubs of privilege an move towards community lead action where those with teh rrealktionship and the long knowledge get to maintain soverentiy and connect their history with their future.

We have a way to support Thi grassroots storytelling through teh empathy ledger which is part tell amazing stories that we tell nd thing about different ways it turns into art, writing and videos and then supporting others to take teh same process and there is capacity for people to use the platform to host them, to use for the process and then also to build this reposnity of empathy ledger people that sign up to have =theur storuyes par to the the overall empathy ledger and take back ownership for others to apply to work with them in response to a better system of impact storytelling and working out value for stories aknnd kneoldge - especially of indiegsnbou knowledges where they can either have the knowledge stories for their own use and kinship purposes or to share with teh world to celebrate and support understanding and knowledge.

We have the capacity to support people where they are at and then also invite them to be present with us in the fair location - but also have the capacity to provide pop up dinner experiences and other collective experience to support relations and joint understanding - this should be built upon the principles and protocols of the organisations and communities we work with.

This is a future that is based on regeneration of community connection and the opportunities to reclaim things that have been left alone and reignite ideas that have been moved pas too quickly. Many of the issues that we use power and influence to change can be solved through community capacity building and shaping up teh leaders in the community to support others to come with them.

For examples Brodie Germaine in Mount Isa had a vision to support more young people in his community. A path he had taken in his younger years connects him closer to this experience and has provided the perfect roadmap to being supporter by philanthropy and giernmetn to now running his Camping on Country program and support hundreds of young people with this experience. Brodie is supported through teh Empathy Ldger platform to tell real stories form elders dn young people,, he had build his website eon teh empathy ledger tehcnoplpogy and is building his impact and community connection framework with teh platform.

Then the PICC example and how we build out the site and then we build teh Barkely Bakcbone petnetila
