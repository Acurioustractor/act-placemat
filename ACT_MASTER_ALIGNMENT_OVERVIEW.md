# A Curious Tractor — Alignment Master Brief

## Why This Document Exists
- Translate extensive strategy archives into a shared, first-principles compass we can review together.
- Anchor every decision in Beautiful Obsolescence while simplifying how we communicate ACT’s system.
- Focus immediate energy on place-based development around the Witta, QLD farm and neighbouring regions.

---

## 1. Core Identity & Philosophy
- **Movement, not organisation** — ACT embodies a philosophy that proves two people can catalyse global change by becoming unnecessary (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:8-33`).
- **Beautiful Obsolescence** is the guiding system: projects (6-24m), organisations (3-7y), and the philosophy itself (7-15y) are designed to hand back power (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:20-57`).
- **Values locks** keep us honest: Radical Humility, Creative Disruption, Truth-Telling, Indigenous Wisdom Primacy, Anti-Extraction, Joyful Seriousness (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:79-121`).
- **Rocket Booster model** defines the cadence of support → independence (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:58-77`).
- **True philosophy alignment**: we build systems that make extraction impossible and celebrate adventure, art, curiosity, and giving (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_TRUE_PHILOSOPHY_ALIGNMENT.md:1-82`).

### First-Principles Checklist
1. **Does this increase community sovereignty?** (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_DATA_PHILOSOPHY_INTEGRATION.md:5-44`)
2. **Are we handing over power on an explicit timeline?** (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:275-308`)
3. **Are stories owned and shared by the communities involved?** (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_TRUE_PHILOSOPHY_ALIGNMENT.md:11-34`)
4. **Are we removing extractive economics and replacing them with community-owned value?** (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:196-233`)
5. **Will this help ACT disappear gracefully while communities thrive?** (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:22-57`)

## 2. System Overview — Intelligence in Service of Obsolescence
- **Knowledge Graph Inputs**: 10 Notion databases (projects, people, orgs, opportunities, stories, events, tasks, notes, media, tags) (`ACT_KNOWLEDGE_WIKI_DATA_INVENTORY.md:9-104`).
- **Operational Cache**: Supabase tables for LinkedIn contacts, Gmail messages, Xero finances, cadence metrics (`NOTION_SUPABASE_SUMMARY.md:17-95`).
- **Comms & Calendar**: Gmail, Google Calendar, automation hooks for relationship intelligence (`ACT_KNOWLEDGE_WIKI_DATA_INVENTORY.md:120-222`).
- **AI & Automation**: Skill Pods, intelligence orchestrator, data guardians that enforce sovereignty (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_DATA_PHILOSOPHY_INTEGRATION.md:54-135`).
- **Frontend Direction**: Knowledge Wiki with universal search, entity hubs, AI “Ask ACT”, transparency layers (`FRONTEND_REDESIGN_PLAN.md:1-206`).

**Design Imperatives**
- Every interface must surface context across people ↔ projects ↔ organisations ↔ stories simultaneously.
- Dashboards prioritise project independence, relationship health, and opportunity alignment over financial vanity metrics.
- AI experiences default to curiosity-led prompts (e.g. “Which Witta projects are closest to transfer?”) rather than transactional queries.

## 3. Portfolio Snapshot (September 2025 data)
- **Projects enumerated**: 64 entries with real metadata (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/notion-projects-complete-analysis.json:#L1-L41`).
- **Themes leading the portfolio**: Storytelling (26), Health & Wellbeing (19), Youth Justice (15), Indigenous sovereignty (13) (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2460-2574` & `complete-ecosystem/projects.json:1400-1435`).
- **Status mix**: Active 🔥 (33), Ideation 🌀 (17), Transferred ✅ (5), Sunsetting 🌅 (4), Internal (2), with three awaiting status updates (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2466-2496`).
- **Revenue signals**: Six projects report actual income totalling $162.5k (e.g. `Project Her Self design`, `Wilya Janta Communications`, `BG Fit`, `PICC - Storm Stories`, `Goods.`) (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:1054-1195`, `1814-1839`, `2345-2383`, `2466-2498`).
- **Opportunities linkage**: 25 projects already tied to funding or partnership opportunities, signalling where capital matchmaking is working (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2401-2438`).

### Pattern Highlights
- Story sovereignty initiatives (JusticeHub, Empathy Ledger, PICC storytelling suite) form the connective tissue for truth-telling and transparency (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2287-2437`).
- Youth justice ecosystem spans BG Fit, MMEIC Justice Projects, Murrup + ACT, Bimberi programs — demonstrating the Rocket Booster cadence in practice (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:1814-1888`, `2345-2385`).
- Economic freedom projects (Goods., Go big // Funding ACT, Custodian Economy) cultivate community-owned production and alternative financing (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:1054-1435`, `2466-2567`).

## 4. Place-Based Focus — Witta & Surrounding Sunshine Coast Region
### Current Assets & Commitments
- **Witta Farm** operating as retreat, gathering, and prototyping site referenced in network conversations (`Docs/LinkedIn/Bens_data/messages.csv:5-8`).
- **Witta Harvest HQ** active project driving regenerative community space with Decentralised Power at its core (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2543-2574`).
- **Seed House Witta** appears across financial policy and partnership planning, signalling a flagship land-stewardship partnership (`apps/backend/core/config/financial-policy.yaml:12-76`).
- **Regional partner web** includes Sunshine Coast councils, universities, and community champions (e.g. `Docs/LinkedIn/Bens_data/Connections.csv:15`, `Docs/LinkedIn/Bens_data/Connections.csv:3597`).

### First-Principles Priorities for Place Work
1. **Country-Led Stewardship** — Embed Indigenous governance and cultural protocols (aligns with Locked Value #1) before any infrastructure decisions (`Docs/Strategy/ACT_MASTER_PHILOSOPHY_2025.md:275-308`).
2. **Community Production & Learning** — Use Goods., Witta Harvest HQ, Seed House Witta as a living lab for regenerative manufacturing, food systems, and story documentation.
3. **Hospitality & Respite** — Position the farm as neutral ground for youth justice partners, storytellers, and Elders to rest, plan, and cross-pollinate ideas.
4. **Data & Story Kiosk** — Co-design a local transparency node (case study wall, media library, community briefing screens) that mirrors the Knowledge Wiki for visitors.
5. **Regional Cadence** — Map relationships, cadence alerts, and shared opportunity pipeline for Sunshine Coast and Hinterland partners so follow-up is community driven.

### Immediate Experiments
- **Witta Residency Program**: quarterly invitations for partners to co-design or test interventions on-country (e.g. justice reinvestment prototyping weekends).
- **Neighbourhood Knowledge Walks**: document land history, current custodians, ecological indicators to enrich project records and AI context.
- **Local Supplier Ledger**: track cooperative economics (farm inputs, artisans, transport) to model circular spending and inform Goods. expansion.

---

## 5. Relationship & Support Infrastructure
- **Community Partnership Approach** details how we open every relationship with listening, sliding-scale reciprocity, and capacity building (`Docs/Strategy/Community/COMMUNITY_PARTNERSHIP_APPROACH.md:1-148`).
- **Rocket Booster Framework** provides the coaching cadence and success milestones for handover (`Docs/Strategy/Community/ROCKET_BOOSTER_FRAMEWORK.md:1-112`).
- **Network CRM Roadmap** links LinkedIn intelligence with Notion and Supabase for contact cadence, ensuring relationship health stays visible (`Docs/Strategy/NETWORK_CRM_ROADMAP.md:1-160`).
- **Story Amplification Philosophy** ensures every engagement reinforces community story ownership (`Docs/Strategy/Community/STORY_AMPLIFICATION_PHILOSOPHY.md:1-136`).

Key questions before deepening any partnership:
- Who already holds authority for this Country or community group?
- What reciprocal benefit do we bring that accelerates their goals, not ours?
- How soon can we begin the knowledge transfer plan to make our role optional?

## 6. Focus Areas for the Next Quarter
1. **Knowledge Wiki Implementation** — Deliver Morning Brief, Relationship Hub, and Projects view with data workbench overlays so the team can navigate 64 projects and associated contacts with confidence (`FRONTEND_REDESIGN_PLAN.md:45-206`).
2. **Place-Based Data Health** — Ensure Witta-linked projects have complete metadata: status, milestones, revenue flows, land coordinates, partner orgs (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2538-2574`).
3. **Story Sovereignty Toolkit** — Package storytelling workflows (PICC suite, JusticeHub, Empathy Ledger) for on-farm residencies and partner training (`.taskmaster/docs/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/complete-ecosystem/projects.json:2287-2440`).
4. **Capital Alignment** — Stand up a capital & resourcing dashboard that aggregates Potential/Actual Incoming and linked opportunities for Sunshine Coast initiatives.
5. **Obsolescence Scorecard** — Prototype a shared metric board tracking community ownership %, cadence health, and readiness for ACT exit across priority projects.

---

## 7. Open Questions for Our Sense Check
- What evidence do we need to prove ACT is truly disappearing from day-to-day operations in Witta-led projects?
- Which partners should be invited to the first Witta Residency to test the knowledge wiki + place practices together?
- Where are our current gaps in Indigenous governance participation or consent for farm-based activities?
- What data or stories remain locked in personal inboxes or offline archives that the Knowledge Wiki must ingest first?
- How do we document ecologically the impact of regenerative practices on the farm to inform future land-based expansions?

---

## 8. Next Actions (Proposed)
1. **Workshop (2 hrs)** — Review this brief with core team, confirm first-principles alignment, identify missing context.
2. **Metadata Sprint (1 week)** — Complete Witta-related project records (milestones, partners, revenue, story assets, land data).
3. **Place Residency Design (2 weeks)** — Co-design pilot residency agenda, participant list, and success measures rooted in Rocket Booster exit criteria.
4. **Dashboard Build (3 weeks)** — Deliver Knowledge Wiki Phase 1 modules + Sunshine Coast cadence dashboards for daily use.
5. **Obsolescence Review Rhythm** — Schedule bi-monthly reflection using the scorecard to ensure we are measuring independence, not output.
