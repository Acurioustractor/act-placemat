# ACT Network Connections Report

**Generated:** October 25, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the network connectivity of all 65 ACT projects based on their relationships with supporters, organizations, people, and other projects.

### Network Density Distribution

| Density Category | Connection Range | Project Count | Percentage |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Isolated** | 0-5 connections | 43 | 66.2% |
| **Developing** | 6-15 connections | 11 | 16.9% |
| **Resilient** | 16-30 connections | 10 | 15.4% |
| **Antifragile** | 31+ connections | 1 | 1.5% |

**Total Projects:** 65

### Key Finding: Beautiful Obsolescence Challenge

**Low relationship density is the main blocker for Beautiful Obsolescence.** Projects in the "Isolated" and "Developing" categories lack the robust network connections needed for sustainable, transformative change. Building deeper relationships across supporters, organizations, people, and related projects is critical for project success.

- **0-5 connections (Isolated)**: 43 projects are at high risk of stagnation or failure. These projects need immediate network building efforts.

- **6-15 connections (Developing)**: 11 projects are beginning to build networks but remain vulnerable. Continued relationship cultivation is essential.

- **16-30 connections (Resilient)**: 10 projects have established strong networks and can weather challenges through collaborative support.

- **31+ connections (Antifragile)**: 1 projects demonstrate exceptional network density, enabling them to grow stronger through challenges and adapt dynamically.

### Recommendations

1. **Priority Focus**: Invest resources in the 43 Isolated projects to build foundational relationships
2. **Network Weaving**: Create intentional connections between projects with complementary themes and locations
3. **Success Modeling**: Study the 1 Antifragile projects to understand their relationship-building strategies
4. **Continuous Cultivation**: Maintain momentum for Developing and Resilient projects to prevent regression
